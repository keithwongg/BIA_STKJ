[{"videoId": "WdS7Os7u4dY", "textDisplay": "Hey, so before I talk about anything else I want to say that I was interviewed on my friend Coca\u2019s podcast, if you\u2019d like a little insight into my creative process and shit I think you\u2019ll really enjoy it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR8V2fLps6U\n\nI\u2019ve also started selling merch, for anyone who wanted to support my channel financially without using my Patreon. Hiring artists to do the designs for me since I want them to actually be decent looking, gonna make a video once I\u2019ve got a couple more: https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/ShammyTV/\n\nOKAY now that that\u2019s out of the way, I should explain what made this video take so long, aside from the obvious fact that it\u2019s roughly 4 times as long as the reviews I used to make when I was posting monthly:\n\nTL;DR - While working on this review I was dealing with some personal mental health problems, partially brought on by stress and partially brought on by the fact that I had to put down two childhood dogs during the writing process. Throw in the fact that I was talking about a game that I\u2019m really not passionate about at this point and you get a recipe for a 4 month creation timeline, and that\u2019s not even mentioning my steadily rising stupid level of detail that I put into these reviews in both the editing and writing process, as far as I can remember there are more hidden jokes in this review than normal ones.\n\nWhich leads me to another point - I\u2019m not going to be making any more long form reviews like this one in the near future, and if I ever make one again it\u2019s going to be for a game I *really* care about so that i don\u2019t run out of steam halfway through working on it. I know these reviews are a bit contentious with my audience, I\u2019ve heard an equal number of people saying they prefer either the shorter and longer reviews, but for my own sake I\u2019m going to be moving back to around 15-20 minute videos. My goal for this year is to upload at least 1 high quality video per month, and I\u2019m very excited about the three I\u2019ve got lined up after this one.\n\nSorry this took me so long to make, I\u2019ve been staring at it for so long I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s bearable to watch. Hope you liked it.\n\nAlso, for anyone who isn\u2019t aware, I do a bi-weekly podcast with 3 of my friends called \u201cPlease Stop Talking.\u201d The first episode was pretty rough but I think we\u2019ve really found our footing, and if you like my reviews I think there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll enjoy it.

It fits the character your going with and is not overly melancholic or sassy. The highs and lows of this character are noticeable, but not annoyingly overstated (And, of course, the highs are scarce compared to the lows). The owl is also a charming carrier of that personality. With the constant \"I'm annoyed\" expression the character is perfectly described, without having had to actually state it. I'm new to the channel, so I'm not sure if there actually may be some kind of character development. Also, the american badass tropes are not overdone and flow into the gag without being too annoying (which I like a lot, since it retains your pride for your country, but doesn't take over the figurative stage)\nThough, I find your alcoholism and self-loathing gags to be melodramatic and unfitting for the \"I don't want to be here\" and \"I'm right\" kind of character you made. Maybe I'm talking out of my ass and you deliberately crafted this character to be this way, as to make it seem desperate to be liked, though it already has kind of given up on that. However, I remain with what I said: It's unfitting. More fitting would be a fokus on the \"I'm right/ better\" part of the character and making it a character that feels itself to be better than others, with the desperation being retained by the occasional \"God, I feel like shit\" moment. I think that would give you more space for jokes as well as it would pronounce those that are actually kind of funny. Indeed, your approach to the \"fanbase pressure\" gag was not only unoriginal, but also unfunny. For a creator that really got me interested in what he was trying to say and being funny troughout stepwise, I believe that you can definitely do better than that.\nI would like to add that I'm in no way an actual critic and just tried to get across how I feel about your alter ego.\n\nTL;DR: Luv ya.

(also something thats seen in that one movie War Games, AS AN EXAMPLE.)\nMATRIX will run simulation after simulation after simulation. and just keep going and going until set prediction parameter limit is met. or a winning scenario is made for the favored faction (or team, or goal, or point, ect).\nJust think of it as like a encrypted file cracker. or electric lock cracker. it will keep pushing out scenarios as many times, multiplied by each character needed. until someone gets it right. or they all do. or till the prediction parameter limit is hit.\n(say i set the limit of scenarios to like 15,000,000. the computer will only make 15,000,000 what if scenarios or till it gets one right. given the user meaning. if you or the computer cant get it right then the odds are too low to succeed. so to by extension, the system shuts the MATRIX down.)\n===\nSO. now think of it this way. if what you said is gathered correctly. that it can mean anything and everything. then its Quantum. and its running MATRIX.

I have a few things.\n\n1. An EXP system with various skills sort of like a Runescape type of thing.  You have mining skill, flying skill, running skill, trading skill, strength skill, armor skill, etc...whatever else you can think of.  This would encourage you to enjoy doing even the mst monotonous things, since you'd always be getting EXP, even just running.\n\n2.  The ability to wear actual armor.  Maybe they protect from different types of weather, increase your health or defense, or have certain perks that can help you in the game.\n\n3.  The ability to kill creatures on other planets and collect drops from them and gain EXP.  Find a powerful creature?  You may get a rare drop.\n\n4.  A procedurally generated boss on every single planet. Super powerful, all unique looking with different attacks.\n\n5. The ability to create bases without having to fly to the stupid ass space station to pick up a crew member.  God, I hated this.  Honestly, if the game just let you be able to do everything on one planet, I'd be set.  I like my base planet, I hate having to fly everywhere unless I want to see a new planet that I haven't been to yet.  This brings me to my final and probably biggest point.\n\n6. Take the manual flying out completely.  I know they were trying to go for a realistic thing here, but my God...those flying segments are absolute garbage.

If you bought into imagination land from day one, your assessment is correct. BUT, if you were a smart consumer you wouldn't have bought into the hype to begin with. I paid full price for a game that had no microtransactions, no multiplayer, free exploration in space for what amounts to eternity, and creatures that actually have families, predators that you can observe stalking their prey, planets that effectively try to kill you just for landing on them, and just a chill experience.

The thumbnail of this video has an owl reading the bible on it so everyone is like OMG!!! AN OWL MADE A VIDEO ABOUT NO MANS SKY BETTER CHECK THIS OUT. But its obvious almost immediately that he's not a real owl because his eyes move in their sockets (real owls cant do this). Its a dirty form of click bait and anyone who denies this also denies the holocaust by proxy\n\n2 - The lack of quality: If this is a video game that actually exists and not something you made up entirely. Then why can I only find 1 video about it on dailymotion? This guy is trying sooo hard to stand out that instead of actually taking the time to made a quality video he just throws together a 40 min video (which btw it would take more than 40 minutes to explain video games you sh*t stain) with a few sixteeth ass statements and almost no other points besides \"the game doesn't work real game do this so much better\". Have you considered that maybe real games do it better because they actually exist? You cant just say those words in that order and act like its a sentence, thats not how it works bud. You have to actually take time to open OBS and use Afterburner as your professional benchmarking tool... but you didnt and the quality of this video really shows it.
