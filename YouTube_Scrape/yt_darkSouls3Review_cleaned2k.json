That's not an issue just with DS3, but all of the demon's dark souls blood games, all of them share this issue and something as old as Diablo 2, is far more replayable.\nThere is a limit to it sure, but you can play it for hundreds upon hundreds of hours and not get bored.\n\na couple of things that D2 I feel did better is, enemies becoming their own nightmare, less NG+ meant more focus and concentrated effort upon giving the enemies some truly demonic powers.. and speeds.. The game gets really hard in Nightmare, but it gets extremely fucking hard in Hell, when enemies start blitzing at the speed of lightning through the screen, with auras fucking you up, enchanted properties, strong and agile champions, as well as champion minions, etc.\n\n2nd thing, items. This is arguably the best part of the D2 nightmare and hell, especially the latter, finding the unique items took many, many, many years for people and having those accessible for the parts of the game they would make sense to exist in, either Nightmare or Hell, that makes it all better, because it gives those portions a reason to be played, other than for bragging rights, which is how the series here is.\n\n3rd thing, Uber bosses. That's the thing this demon's dark souls blood series could've done and hell, they even showed they could do it, with Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. It's not the best way of doing, nor how I would want it, the better way would be sequence breaking within the main game and finding other areas, or other bosses, made specifically to be fought in that difficulty, or just 1 optional area at least if not that, even though a couple more for the challenge's sake would be a just reward to players who put so much effort into the NG+ -es of these games.\nFor an example, think of something like this almost hidden secret in the main game, something that can be accessed right now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3xkM700bSk This is cool, this gives us Real reasons to play NG+.\n\n\n\nTo me, that kind of rewarding of exploration and dedication is very important, that's what initially made me put through the effort into Diablo 2's later modes when I was a teen and it's what initially made these games worth playing in the first time I was playing them and I've been struggling since to find interest in continuing NG+ on any of them,  unless the motivation is the desire not to leave these games, which is really depressing if that's how some people justify it, isn't it?..\nNG+ in almost all of them seems rather barren and lost in meaning when you already have all of the items, a lot of the game is gone once you've already acquired all of those items and that's cool that you have that, but you're set on a Hard limit too with your stats and how far your weapons can go. What I'm talking about here is, it could have been much better and I think FromSoftware have had more than enough years to tinker and go crazy with such ideas, or maybe they just never had the suggestions, or the thought never crossed their minds, but the one thing I can say in their defense is that, in some cases, they tried and it doesn't mean that I hate the games, it's just more of a missed golden opportunity to make these games, the most played games of for the next 10 or so years from now, as well as cementing our trust into them for any future games to come.", "likeCount": 0,

through the remastered version of Dark Souls 1 i actually disagree with you in terms of the bosses, the variety of bosses in DS1 to me is staggering, im not completely finished with the game yet but i can already tell that the enemies and bosses all seem unique compared to dark souls 3, most of the bosses in ds3 seem mostly the same, the arenas that you fight the bosses in are great but the bosses themselves dont have that awe factor that ds1 has, the gaping dragon in ds1 is a great example of this to me, i remember watching it poke its small head above the ledge and thinking that it was going to be an easy fight, but then as soon as it crawled up onto the ledge it took my breath away with how shocking the reveal was, in ds3 there are none of these reveals that take your breath away, the only boss that i can think of in ds3 that can come close to the bosses of ds1 is the abyss watchers. Personally i perfer the fact you can warp to and from all bonfires in ds3 but i can appreciate the world design in ds1, another thing that sticks out to me in ds1 is the enemy and location variety, you can go from fighting the hollowed knights of lordran to fighting a giant hydra in minutes. Which is another thing that sticks out to me, some of the standard enemies of ds1 could stand out as a great boss in ds3, the stone nights, the hydra, the hell knight dragon. All of these enemies and more would stand out and be completely unique compared to the standard enemies and bosses of ds3.

About the build diversity: yes, a lot of the weapons have the same functionality, but that doesnt mean they arent uniqe. and most of the weapons that do have the same functionality can still be used in a different way for a specific build. Dark souls three is the last game of the series so of course it will have every weapon from the previous games and it has PLENTY of its own arsenal of weaponry. Especially when you count the DLC weapons. That being said, i pvp all the time and have never seen 2 of the same builds.\n\nConcerning the level design: I absolutely HATE when people shit on DS3 level design and complain that its linear and that its not interconnected. Those are both false accusations. It is linear at the very beggining(the whole teleport thing) but once you get to the forrest where you have 2 paths to branch off from its pretty much open. Not to mention the numerous side paths in the (linear) parts of the game that lead to very useful npc's and various items that will help  you along the way.

(On my 4th, I was dumbfounded when Nashandra didn't show up after the Throne W&D fight. And Aldia never showed up either afterward,  which I avow not to let happen this 5th time, NG++).  \n       I loved DaS1 up til Anor Londo (best part of any game I've played), like AL, and find the rest irritating to the point that I don't really like to play the game.  I've never played more than half of NG+, on 5 toons.  When I realized I loved DaS2 more than DaS1 was at a point in which my head had been hurting for several sessions just trying to figure out where to go and what to do next.  It was lovely.  I have to look past its graphical inferiorites, which is easy, because it is a massively fun GAME. So many route choices (again, Bonfire Ascetics), so many viable PvE and PvP builds, it just makes for a lot of fun because of how such a variety of options can be expressed in your toon, aesthetic, and such when co-oping.  This is because, over the course of a few New Game Plusses (BAs!), your toon will have progressed through those cycles in myriad ways differently than everyone you meet.  This means you meet a lot of people doing they own thang. It's cool.  Plus the weighty, tactical, slower pace of DaS2 just fuckin' works for PvP IMO.  Join the Blues and you won't even have to worry about opening up the World to invade everywhere.  (Ask if you want a hot 2018 tip on constant CBEO invasion, 20-30 in just a few hours.

It wouldn\u2019t make sense if it wasn\u2019t linear. However, after the abyss watchers, or arguably carthus, it would make sense to switch to a less linear style.

Pve was good, for the first three playthroughs, then got repetitive. The overwhelming commitment to different builds, and ad on top of that *all of them (except quality builds)* were fucking shite. Just made me feel like it wasnt worth it, my first character ended up being over leveled to actually enjoy pvp so i had to creat a new one. Theres nothing wrong with that except for the fact that i was doing it for one specific reason, pvp. Which wasnt a good investment either considering i kept getting *ganked every time i fucking invaded*.\nWhile pvp is absolutely horrible and *very unfair for invaders*, especially for new-time invaders who\u2019ve never, EVER played any previous souls game (like myself). I found that i was constantly at a disadvantage whenever i invaded, or have no advantage at all, as in, not being able invade in the first place. \nHaving to invade in the same area to even INVADE got really boring, and got really repetitive really quickly. It really is such a shame to see all the beautiful area\u2019s from has made go to waste because one specific spot lets me invade quicker. \nInvasions was an awful, unfun and unfair experience. While the undead arena is more fair than invading, it too also got *really boring*, and i again felt like i wasnt getting any better at pvp. Yeah i would win some matches here and there, and yes i did get a gold medal a couple of times. But whenever i invaded i felt like all those matches were a waste of time, because i end up getting ganked *again* and all that time in the arena trying to get better at pvp, were wasted.\n       While the pvp aspect is fucking horrible lets focus on the pve side of things, pve can be summarized in a couple of words. Here are those words; repetitive, boring, challenging, frustrating and easy.\nWhile pve was fun at first, the charm quickly ran its course and felt dull, lifeless and boring. And yes it is challenging, sometimes it gets frustratingly unfair because of stun mechanics (like pvp), not only that but the fact that some of the bosses were literal jokes if you knew what you were doing (and at this point you do considering that its now newgame+5 and you\u2019ve killed them more times then you can count).\n         Ds3 was my favorite game for awhile, then it stopped being that shortly there after. And having ds3 as the last game in the series left me feeling jipped as a customer, i say customer because i personally havent played the previous games and have no real emotional connection to the game or franchise. If you want my honest opinion about ds3, i loved it. But i just got bored of it, and if you guys are right, about your guys\u2019s claim about the *previous* games being better. Then ds3 is a horribly dull, unorganized, visually stunning laughing stock of a sequel.\n\nTL;DR \nif your new to the franchise and is actually looking to buy this game, buy it. Its a great *first-experience rpg* , but dont expect any replay-ability once you\u2019ve beat the game at least three times. Both elements are weak in this game, pvp is unbalanced, frustrating, and boring. Pve is dull, challenging at first, then laughably easy later.\n5/10\nMediocre at best.", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2017-10-09T18:03:14.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-09T18:04:07.000Z", "textProcessed": "actual review someone knew franchise sunk 700 hour felt never got good pp ve ve good three playthroughs got repetition overwhelming commitment different build ad top except quality build fucking white made feel want worth character ended leveled actually enjoy pp great new there nothing wrong except fact specific reason pp want good investment either considering kept getting asked every time fucking invaded pp absolutely horrible unfair invader especially teatime invader whole never ever played previous found constantly disadvantage whenever invaded advantage able invade place invade area even invade got really boring got really repetition really quickly really shame see beautiful area made go waste specific spot let invade quicker invasion awful union unfair experience under arena fair invading also got really boring felt want getting better pp yeah would win match yes gold medal couple time whenever invaded felt match waste time end getting asked time arena trying better pp wasted pp aspect fucking horrible let focus ve side thing ve summarized couple word word repetition boring challenging frustration easy ve fun charm quickly ran course felt dull lifeless boring yes challenging sometimes get frustratingly unfair sun mechanic pp fact boss literal joke knew point considering newgame5 you killed time count is favorite awhile stopped shortly is last series left feeling lipped customer say customer personally haven played previous real emotional connection franchise want honest opinion is loved got bored gun right guess claim previous better is horribly dull unorganized usually stunning laughing stock sequel old new franchise actually looking buy buy great firstexperience rug dont expect replayability you beat least three time element weak pp balanced frustration boring ve dull challenging laughably easy later 510 mediocre best"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "I wish we still had more content coming out for DS3...gimme more DLCs so that my journey may continue... \\[T]/", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2017-10-09T17:18:20.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-09T17:18:34.000Z", "textProcessed": "wish still content coming ds3gimme doc journey may continue"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "My favorite thing about dark souls 1 that immersed me was getting lost, listening to the npcs woes, and the difficulty.

You enjoyed the DS1 experience, as did I. You make points about the fact that DS3 doesnt connect its areas in the same way DS1 did and instead we are given the ability to warp.  You also commend DS3 for being a very good game. I agree with most of the things you have to say. But.\n\nNOW my friendly opinion on why this ISNT a good review.\n\nYour sense of eliteism and entitlement shines through this 'review'. You mention it yourself, if you took away the these to emotions your review would be hollow. You are simply knitpicking small things and then spend time talking about how you actually dont have the right to complain about it, (because you dont have the right). \n\nYou seem to have trouble figuring out exactly why DS1 managed to connect its areas more widely and why the later installments dont measure up in this regard. So I will explain.\nDS1 have routes that connect areas. It makes sense topographically that the areas would be there but lore-wise its so god damn stupid, cities stacked on cities, crystal caverns, underground lakes with archtrees and burnings depths all within walkingdistance. DS3 gives you the option to warp because now you arent exploring a hill of different civilizations stacked on top of eachother, you are exploring a world, Irythil cant be on top of Lothric castle or viceversa because it makes no sense. To tell the story you know and love to be DS3 they need to expand the universe and fill it with different cultures and detail (which you commended in the review). The story is what connects the areas, the characters binds it all together, you should know that with 50k subs on a darksouls channel.\n\n\"I miss that feeling of getting lost, and it being of how complex the world felt, not because I was missing out on a silly mechanic\".\nAre you serious....This sounds poetic but its so stupid coming from a 'reviewer'. The world of DS3 IS complex, DS3 shouldnt have to rely stuff like this to entertain the player.\nImagine someone saying to the dev team of DS3 \"Yeah I walked around in circles for hours in DS1 because I had trouble finding my way, i had a blast, is there any way to incorporate that in the next DS?\"\n\nAnd the weapons, man the negativity from you is crazy. You start of by saying youve PVPed for 2 years and then you complain about the diversity of weapons. Its a medival game with swords, shields and staffs. There is a limit to how many variations you can have without turning this into a fucking ninjagame. You complain about the movesets being similar but neglect all the awesome flipping and sliding attacks from tons of weapons. The awesome weaponarts from bossweapons. PVP isnt the focus of this game and yet its kept so many people entertained for years. Look at the awesome footage you have where knights run around fighting with blessed swords, spears and greatswords. \n\nWhat other game outside the DS franchise can you compare DS3 this to? Who did this better? You have no other reference.\n\nIm trying to be contructive, not negative. You love the franchise so much that you consider it a work of gods.

As someone else on Steam said\n(here's the full post http://steamcommunity.com/app/374320/discussions/0/365163686085640733/)\nThis game isn't Dark Souls, it's Bloodborne Knight Edition.\n\nThis is why I've hated Dark Souls 3 so much on gameplay. Because the author of that post is right, the enemies and bosses are incredibly, ridiculously fast and attack so rapidly. Some of them even attack with absolutely no telegraphing for you to avoid the attacks. Meanwhile, your character is slow and sluggish, takes forever to swing a f**king straight sword let alone the slow rolling and absurd vitality system.\nExamples of this would be the stick holding hollows, corvians, dogs, and even bosses like Gael and Dragonslayer armor. Everything is fast and aggressive, and while I absolutely love that style of gameplay, it doesn't work when your character is far slower and more bulky. And sure, there's plenty of dark souls pro's who can beat the game without any hits, and as Pargon shows, beats bosses like the Souls of Cinder and Gael without being hit, but you CANNOT expect every player in the world to have that level of ability or to have the same level of enjoyment.\nBloodborne is my favorite Fromsoft game despite it's flaws because it's so fast and aggressive and fun to play! I love dodging around my opponent and slashing at them with a fast weapon while they viciously try to tear me apart. But it simply wouldn't work if the player wasn't as fast as they were.\n\nI think if Dark Souls 3 had your character be as fast as the Bloodborne hunters were and made the way we swing our weapons more realistically (more fast) but didn't have the benefit of the rally potential mechanic, it would have balanced it perfectly. Now builds that don't turtle behind shields feel rewarded because they're quick and dangerous like their enemies and are rewarded for playing like that.", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-06T20:05:19.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-06T20:05:19.000Z", "textProcessed": "want see people respond opinion mine keep mind love still give 710 hear reason least favorite fromsoft aside shit pp stale abundance weapon lack interesting character compared previous title many reference older later world design complete identity crisis mean feel can decide whether bloodborne someone else steam said here full post httpsteamcommunitycomapp374320discussions0365163686085640733 isn bloodborne knight edition give hated much gameplay author post right enemy boss incredibly ridiculously fast attack rapidly even attack absolutely telegraphing avoid attack meanwhile character slow sluggish take forever swing king straight sword let alone slow rolling absurd vitality system example would stick holding hollow moravians dog even boss gale dragonslayer armor everything fast aggressive absolutely love style gameplay doesn work character far slower bulky sure there plenty pro beat without hit pardon show beat boss cinder gale without hit cannot expect every player world level ability level enjoyment bloodborne favorite fromsoft despite flaw fast aggressive fun play love lodging around opponent splashing fast weapon viciously try tear apart simply wouldn work player want fast think character fast bloodborne hunter made way swing weapon realistically fast didn benefit rally potential mechanic would balanced perfectly build dont turtle behind shield feel rewarded there quick dangerous enemy rewarded playing"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "3:48 THANK YOU, SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS!

This genuinely brings the score down for me.  I understand and appreciate that analysis of the environments is great for some of the hardcore players out there.  Its not for your average player.  I've played through DS3 twice without looking at lore videos and I got nothing but confusion from the story.  It is a definitive downside in the same way that Destiny's 3rd party resource for lore is a downside on that games storyline.  If your storytelling is too cryptic for the majority of your playerbase then you've failed to craft a good story. \n- Death is too punishing.  This is a downside because I don't appreciate having my time wasted.  My issue here isn't the loss of souls or that souls are lost perm after 2 deaths before recovery.  No, my issue is 100% with the run distances between SOME bonfires and their bosses.   Running through 3 minutes of content or fighting through it for the 20th time to attempt a boss is NOT fun and NOT rewarding nor does it enhance the experience.  Dark Souls as a franchise should respawn you at the boss door on death or have less than a 30 second travel time.  I gave it a pass on the original game but by DS3 this has become unforgivable.   Don't waste your players time by boring them.  That's never been good game design and it continues to be poor design in DS3.\n- Item spam/cryptic items/features.  Not telling the player information is flat out bad design.   Having to alt/tab out of the game to understand what something means/does is bad.  If DS as franchise had something in game to learn this stuff I'd give it a pass but it doesn't.   Trial and error of things in games CAN be fun but this isn't an example of that done right.   \n\nI strongly recommend everyone buy or check out Dark Souls 3.  Its been my favorite game of 2017 (I bought it this year as my first ever Souls game) but it has some heavy flaws holding it back from true greatness as well.   I'm not a pvp player so I can't comment on that side of things.  I had no real issue with invasions in the pve game and while I didn't feel they really enhanced anything I can say they didn't detract either.  It was simply a fine way of making the world feel more real.  Perfectly acceptable idea especially since you didn't get spammed with invasions constantly.

I'm glad you're able to see the game objectively and not just throw shade on it because that's what all the sheep like to do. Popular opinion is that DS1 and BB had the best level design of the Soulsborne games, which I agree with. DS3's levels are more linear and lack the level of exploration and discovery of the two aforementioned games. But after your first playthrough, the mysteries of DS1 and BB's worlds have been revealed for the most part, leaving you to complete the laundry list of things required to progress in each subsequent NG. \n\nI think DS3's maps were designed with PVP invasions in mind. As the last(for now) Souls game, it has to be able to sustain the playerbase long after the game is released. Did they succeed? That's debatable. I would have wanted more invadable areas, more location-based covenants, and as you mentioned, more balanced invasion mechanics. That whole area right underneath Nameless King? WTF, Miyazaki, that could have been an epic duelling spot! \n\nThe Undead Arena's maps are super bland. From could have polished those up a bit. But like you, I continue to play. Visually, DS3 is the most skillfully executed installment of the Souls series to date, which is a definite factor in me playing this over replaying DS1 or 2. It's faster, being somewhere between DS2 and BB, and even if the build diversity is somewhat limited, I'm still experimenting with builds and coming up with new fashions almost every week. \n\nI love this game, and I think my Steam profile shows it, lol(just broke 2000 hrs)!

I agree with most of your points. My biggest issue with DS3 is that it has gone into mainstream format, while at the same time, still trying to present itself as a super-challenging game to survive through. By mainstream format, this means dumbed down area transition, more linearity, easier ways to deal with enemies, a more loose PvP system instead of a more studied one, subsequent patches which kept altering PvE elements into an even easier mode (for instance the Angels in Dreg Heap became weak to Hidden Body, phantoms can now attack Vilhelm, etc), subsequent playthroughs offering little reward and no enemy alteration, and the game in itself forcing you to move to higher NGs just to gather rings, and too much nostalgic copy-paste and too many unneeded nods to previous titles which made DS3 look more of a rehash in many occasions.\nThe game is still challenging alright but it simply builds on the fact of your ignorance of boss movesets and enemy placement; it eventually plateaus into a repetitive scene of purely personal choice of redoing everything again.\nMy second biggest issue, however, and one that is far more important to the Souls community at this point, is the improper balancing in a lot of things when it comes to PvP. The invasion system, the inability to invade even when area boss is dead, the useless covenants, the absence of a Dragon Covenant, the nerfed elements that shouldn't have been nerfed like that (like seed and acid surge), the hitbox issues, the copy-pasted arenas (ok the arenas were freebies but still), and ultimately, no real reward for a pvp-focused player after having amassed all the needed Pale Tongues, Forked Tongues, Concord Ears, Human Dregs, and Vertebra Shackles. And the arena's badge system is useless.\n\nDoesn't mean DS3 is a bad game, on the contrary; I really love it, despite its flaws.

I am also fine with the question of whether the age of Dark is even a good thing. We know it was only a matter of time before its arrival, even despite the powerful resistance it was met with... and we know that the Dark and Humanity are one in the same... but that never implied that it was good, only that men's age, and the age of Dark are the same. It actually make a lot of sense for characters to question the inherent nature of Dark.\n\nWhat am I not okay with? Well, from my understanding, the further I tread from Gywn's kingdom of Sunlight and Fire, the more Dark I find. Eventually, I discover the abyss. Seems logical. The game makes a point out of making these things opposites; Sunlight to the Abyss, Fire to Dark. Then suddenly the Profaned Flame comes in. At first, I am very interested. I want to know more of why this thing breaks the mold. Similar the First Flame, it burns away at people's souls, yet \"the abyss can be seen in it.\" The First Flame requires powerful souls to stay lit, but the profaned flame burns on with complete disregard for any kindling. In fact, putting it out seems to be impossible.\n\nAnd these questions are never answered.... they aren't even touched on. The game shows you that Fire and Dark are different extremes on the same spectrum. But then they give you the Profaned Flame,  which isn't even a middle ground, is just borrowing parts of both extremes, and then gives you 0 context on how to understand. It defies everything, and it only does so, so that you'll think its cool.... and maybe because they realized that giving you a dark coal wouldn't make sense, so they tried to make \"abyss fire\" a thing, and made a \"story\" around it, which failed to actually present not only its own story, but to add anything to the overall story of Dark Souls as well.\n\nTo summarize my problem: It exists, and contributes nothing. Its like asking \"How loud does a baby frog croak?\" only to realize that tadpoles do not croak. It's a trick. You think about it, but then you are told the answer, nothing meaningful transpires.", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-05T01:28:18.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-05T01:28:18.000Z", "textProcessed": "small grape story writing come gamerplayer also writes creates enjoys story cut similar cloth in going give example reference thing within franchise perfectly fine man age age suppressed gown action continues suppressed others way another carry whether intention also fine question whether age even good thing know matter time arrival even despite powerful resistance met know humanity never implied good men age age actually make lot sense character question inherent nature okay well understanding tread gown kingdom sunlight fire find eventually discover abyss seems logical make point making thing opposite sunlight abyss fire suddenly profane flame come interested want know thing break mold similar flame burn away people yet abyss seen flame requires powerful stay lit profane flame burn complete disregard kindling fact putting seems impossible question never answered agent even touched show fire different extreme spectrum give profane flame isn even middle ground borrowing part extreme give 0 context understand defines everything you think cool maybe realized giving coal wouldn make sense tried make abyss fire thing made story around failed actually present story add anything overall story well summarize problem exists contributes nothing asking loud baby frog cloak realize tadpole cloak trick think told answer nothing meaningful transpired"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "song names?", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-05T00:38:34.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-05T00:38:34.000Z", "textProcessed": "song name"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "hi", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-05T00:36:10.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-05T00:36:10.000Z", "textProcessed": "hi"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "would it still be the final review if i made one afterwards?", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-05T00:32:40.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-05T00:32:40.000Z", "textProcessed": "would still final review made afterwards"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "\"Positives and negatives\" more like complaints.

A lot of flaws you mentioned are quite nitpicky. There is a huge amount of build variety, some just take more skill to use effectively than others. Spells can wreck people's shit if you're good with them. If you're gonna level up intelligence, you better use your brain to fight people. Invasions are annoying, but that's just a product of people being assholes and that's unavoidable. That's like criticising League of Legends as a game for every little cancerous twat who screams at people and harasses. Pvp is 100% skill based. A naked sl1 character can beat a sl100 character of he's way better, just like how a sl1 player can beat the game faster than a sl100 character. These things are problems, but nowhere near as bad as the problems that plague dark souls 1. The limited teleportation later on can cause you to grind through long areas devoid of much interest or enemies. Example, there is no way to avoid going through lower blighttown 3 TIMES in order to complete the game 100% and 2 times just to win the game. Some bosses are so average or bad that it's annoying to fight them. All the stray demons, bed of chaos, pinwheel, moonlight butterfly. The game has some of the best bosses in the series but is by far the most inconsistent with its boss quality. The PC port has terrible graphics and framerate issues unless you use dsfx and the pvp is downright unplayable, with the balance sucking and main strategy being to lag behind a player and backtab them. Poise breaks everything, no way around it. These are larger flaws that are far more obvious, but they still don't really bother me all that much due to the quality of the rest of the game, and the same goes for Dark Souls 3, except it has fewer larger issues. And the whole level design thing, that's just a different approach, and shouldn't be treated as \"I liked this thing in dark souls 1, so the sequel must do it the same way. Or it's worse\" I they wanted to make the world design the same as dark souls 1 they would have. I would argue that it's just a different experience. I'm not bothered by the linearity. In fact I prefer it. The more time spent travelling in the right direction is less time spent travelling in the wrong direction and being punished for it with enemies out of your league. In fact, I tried to get my little brother to play dark souls 1 and you know why he quit in 30 minutes? Because he had no clue where to go and was bored as a result. Going somewhere in order to find that you shouldn't have gone there in the first place can make it feel like a waste of your time. I'm not speaking for myself here, but I'm sayin that in terms of objective game design quality, it's entirely subjective. Some love it, some hate it. DS3 just chooses not to be that way, but the world still feels interconnected, as old and new locations can be entirely visible from vantage points and the path between them often accessible without a single loading screen, so it feels organic as one area bleeds into the next. It's a different kind of world design, not an objectively worse one. Dark Souls 3 has brought me the most enjoyment, even though I started with Dark Souls 1. Because the visuals, bosses, combat, controls, level design and detail, lore, PvP, I prefer Dark Souls 3 in all these compartments, despite my love for DS1.", "likeCount": 5, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T08:29:23.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T08:29:23.000Z", "textProcessed": "still prefer two 2 need discussion soul 1 lot flaw mentioned quite nitpicky huge amount build variety take skill use effectively others spell wreck people shit your good your donna level intelligence better use brain fight people invasion annoying that product people asshole that unavoidable that criticising league legend every little cancerous that scream people harassed pp 100 skill based naked sly character beat sl100 character he way better sly player beat faster sl100 character thing problem nowhere near bad problem plague 1 limited teleportation later cause grind long area devoid much interest enemy example way avoid going lower blighttown time order complete 100 2 time win boss average bad annoying fight stray demon bed chaos pinwheel moonlight butterfly best boss series far inconsistent quality pp port terrible graphic framerate issue unless use six pp downright unplayable balance sucking main strategy law behind player backtab noise break everything way around larger flaw far obvious still dont really bother much due quality rest go except fewer larger issue whole level design thing that different approach shouldn treated liked thing 1 sequel must way worse wanted make world design 1 would would argue different experience in gathered linearity fact prefer time spent travelling right direction le time spent travelling wrong direction punished enemy league fact tried little brother play 1 know quit 30 minute clue go bored result going somewhere order find shouldn gone place make feel waste time in speaking in saying term objective design quality entirely subjective love hate is chooses way world still feel interconnected old new location entirely visible vantage point path often accessible without single loading screen feel organic area bleeds next different kind world design objective worse brought enjoyment even though started 1 visual boss combat control level design detail lore pp prefer compartment despite love is"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "Kings field videos when", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T07:47:02.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T07:47:02.000Z", "textProcessed": "king field video"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "Wait, why are the Deacons bad?", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T07:22:43.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T07:22:43.000Z", "textProcessed": "wait deacon bad"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "A lot of weapons have a unique R2 in their class.", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T07:14:17.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T07:14:17.000Z", "textProcessed": "lot weapon unique re class"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "Inb4 'too many gimmick bosses'", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T06:59:16.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T06:59:16.000Z", "textProcessed": "in many gimmick boss"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "Please FROM, give us a new game!", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T05:11:18.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T05:11:18.000Z", "textProcessed": "please give u new"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "what a fucking video mate, bravo!", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T04:41:27.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T04:41:27.000Z", "textProcessed": "fucking video mate bravo"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "I want bosses to get new moves in ng+ and all enemies aswell.", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2017-10-04T04:37:17.000Z", "updatedAt": "2017-10-04T04:37:17.000Z", "textProcessed": "want boss new move no enemy swell"}, {"videoId": "RdH_le05Exk", "textDisplay": "The first time I played DS3 I searched the whole firelink shrine and was like: \"Where the hell do I go now?\" I didn't even think of fast travel and expected something like in ds1 and ds2.

And I don't think there ever can be a worthy successor. Dark Souls was never meant to have a sequel. If you pick an ending at 1, they are pretty final: choose to link the flame, and the world continues until it starts fading again (the next NG+ cycle almost serves as a sequel in a way if that's the case) and if you choose to abandon the flame, the age of man begins and everyone ends up killing one another for humanity. Plus, couple this with the fact Miyazaki hates doing sequels and it wasn't his decision to keep the Souls games going... It really shows in Dark Souls 3. \n\nLook at all of the fan service in 3. There is an immense amount of it (fan service isn't inherently bad, but too much shows a lack of creativity) and it almost shamelessly shoves it down your throat with no real reason for it to exist in the world. I think this was Miyazaki just playing it safe. I genuinely don't believe he poured much love into this game as he did the first game. The fact most of the stories are still left open ended tells me that he never intended for them to be explained (like many of us were hoping for pre release). On top of that, the shameless rewrites (glaring at you Fillianore...) are a clear indication he stopped caring. \n\nThe NPCs also suffer from this. None of them are as interesting or heart wrenching as say Siegmeyer's sinking into depression from DS1 or the infamous ending to our dear Sun Bro.

ive been with this series since it started off as demon souls and i couldn't beat it, my ex did though and he got platinum for it on ps3 and when i watched him play it, ohhh man the anger at all the deaths was real lol. next game dark souls and again i couldn't beat the game. that kept going until dark souls 3 came along. yeeeep, thats how i knew the game was easier lol. i also beat bloodborne which i always thought was the easy dark souls to begin with until they made dark souls 3. i love the series though and i know bloodborne isn't from the same company but i see people calling it all \"soulsborne\" so im shoving it in with the souls games, but im kind of glad they made atleast one of them slightly easier for those people who do better when games don't go from 0 to 100. starting off with bloodborne then going from dark souls 3 and then 1 (lol i know right?) is like going from 0 to 30 to 60 to 100, that gradual increase is sometimes needed. the games are still hard too and really it's because of how the game works rather than enemies just being harder to beat. you can't just hit right trigger and kill everything in sight, you have to slow it down and watch patterns and actually block attacks. then theres the invasion aspect (which i hate btw, im not a big pvper so when it happens i just kind of get discouraged) which makes it harder, how the save system/bonfire system works, the item and weapon system, and not to mention that when you use the bonfire or leave and come back, all of the enemies come back to torment you again, its like you just back tracked just to do it again. all of that is what makes these games hard. ive died so many fucking times that honestly, i feel like not being hollow is a power-up like mario's fire flower lol. but if you practice and just keep playing the game you'll know all the enemies moves and can easily defeat them. i did that with one area in bloodborne so i could farm it (the warty witch bosses area) not only for items but for blood points or w/e they're called, the name escapes me atm. im currently trying to beat dark souls 1 and then ill move on to 2 and hopefully i can get 100% on all 4 of the games one day. im glad these games are hard though, i dont like just pressing 1 button and winning all the time, shit gets boring. it's actually helped my gaming skills, see i used to be real good at games when i was like 4 or 5, i mean i knew all the mario secrets and back then we didn't have the internet to find em out, but now im all \"out of shape\" and the soulsborne games are the perfect way to get into \"shape\" again. i also never knew about the no death and no bonfire bonus of those inviso wings and now i REALLY wanna beat the game 100%, well beat it without dying or the bonfires. i like a good challenge in my games, it stimulates my brain. i get bored so easily from depression and A.D.D that i always try to create challenges for myself in games and now that i know about those wings im

This was my first game in the action RNG genre I played completely. I started very badly where I needed help from my brother to beat all bosses in my first playthrough. After multiple playthroughs, I became better at it and I managed to beat all in-game bosses at level 1 in NG+7, plus Sister Friede, Midir, and Demon Prince in the DLCs. The game has so much replay value that it provides room to learn new tricks to fight bosses, new ways to traverse the environment, and to explore weapon builds and fashion souls. Overall, this game is one of my favorites since it is challenging, fair, and it has a deep lore in the story despite that I have to work hard to understand it.

Sadly my dive into to lore spoiled the boss tricks, but not the quality of them.\n\n200+ hours later, one completed playthrough (just shy of 150 hours) and a fairly far second playthrough later on a new character as a Pyromancer (I beat Champion Gundyr and Champion's Gravetender/Greatwolf today).  Needless to say I'm excited for the DS1 remaster (I don't need to get the original port and the mess that it was now) and want a PS4 Pro just to play Bloodbourne now (probably some other games as well, but that's more to justify getting a PS4 if I'm being honest).  DS3 is up there with Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon (the main series Pokemon games as well) and the original Roller Coaster Tycoon (as well as RCT2, RCT3 and RCT Classic on mobile) for me as one of the best video games I've ever played.\n\nThe only boss that I haven't beaten yet is Midir, in fact I haven't even tried to fight the boss myself other than several failed co-op raids as a summon.  But the rest I have, and stinkers aside the overall quality seems to be the best of the games in how consistent the quality of them is, it's not like the other games where you have some truly terrible bosses (Bed of Chaos, most of the uninspired DS2 bosses, the Asylum Demon clones, Pinwheel).\n\nBut my top 5 bosses are;\n1.

The dark souls story presentation went from one of my least favorite parts to one of the best after finishing it. Everything is explained rather realistically if you think about it. Your just as new to this world as your character probably is due to how long he's been resting. So your not just experiencing the world, your character is too. locals don't exposition dump you because your just a random unkindled it wouldn't make sense to waste their breath. The game knows your not gonna pay attention the first time and instead kill everything in your path until you reach the flame. It paints you as a monster killing blindly way more effectively than other games because it's actually your fault. It mocks how predictable you are by telling this story through designing the game to guide (not force) you into making that choice to kill ignorantly. Not some cutscene saying \"look how bad you are with this random explaination you couldn't possibly know about prior\" and because it gives you that option to stop and read to realize what your actually doing and killing it makes YOU feel guilty and responsible.

I then went on to put a few hundred hours into it to get 100% with just my mouse and keyboard. All the bosses were quite memorable so it's difficult to say any favourites. Iudex Gundyr was a fun, straight up fight early in for me.\n\nI'd have to mention it with starting off as a pyromancer as a fun choice, and that the Great Deep Soul is my favourite dark spell for pretty much anything. Unfortunately, it's a 30 reputation unlock with all those PvP groups that ended up being such a grind. Used it with the Scholar's Candlestick and Izalith Staff for a hard hitting spell that costs very little FP. It's really useful for the first stage of the Nameless King due to the projectiles automatically locking onto the head of the dragon. You'll be knocking it down and out of the fight before you know it. \n\nThen you can throw in the high level pyromancy to nuke other players or enemies.

After playing the game for sometime I decided I wanted to platinum the game. So I hunkered down and began the journey. It took me quite a while to get everything (Though the DLC I found quite easy in contrast), then I reached the point where I had to complete the Chalice Dungeons. I personally find the dungeons as the most tedious part of the game, so everyday I would set to complete one dungeon and unlock another for the next. I was at the end of the second to last dungeon, with hype running in my system with just one more trophy for my first Platinum in a FROM title and the chance to face a boss I hadn't touched before. Then it happened.....a power-cut. When power returned I found my save was gone, it was probably the most crushing moment in gaming for me. I was so upset I punched a hole in my bed and boy did I scream. To this day I still haven't go that last trophy or platinum for Bloodborne, I dont have the willpower to do the chalice dungeons again after that heartache.

One of my proudest moments was probably soloing Midir with a Melee character in NG+4. This character is over level 300, and I plan on reaching Max Level with him eventually.\nWhile yes, I would agree, 30 covenant items seem like too much, and something like 15 ou 20 feels like it would be more adequate, consider the following:\nGrinding them out of enemies is the devs solution to keep this game playable even after servers die. Jirard, remember the problem you had with Metroid recently? With Medals you couldn't get because of online? That will never happen with this game. Everything that requires online has a detour.\nThe game will ultimately also give you one or two of those items through each playthrough, so through NG+3 like you were,  you didn't actually need 30, but somewhere around 20 to 25.\nAnd then again, the game doesn't expect you to complete it in such a short amount of time. It expects you to have a covenant on through your playthrough. At times of peak when this game was extremely popular, you could do Sun's Covenant in NG, Aldritches in NG+, Darkmoon in NG++, or any of those mixed and mashed. It still would take you about the same amount of time as grinding, because you're just as likely to fail your mission; but the point is, the covenants expect you to do what the covenants wants you to in coop.

It was the only one in the series I hadn't beaten yet thanks to the horrors of Blight Town, and the hype surrounding Ornstein and Smough made me hesitant to push forward.  And ya know, they were deserving of that hype.  Had to gain a few levels, learn how to parry in the process, find out Ornstein can't be parried, grind a few more levels, and eventually learn how the bosses work meaning I probably didn't need all those extra levels in the first place but screw it I got 'em let's move on.\n\nBut when I faced up against Gwyn, saw his bedraggled corpse flailing about, noticed how easy he was to parry... I felt hollow.  The music was a good fit for the mood I had after mercilessly beating the last boss of the game, last boss of the series to me, to an embarrassing pulp.  There was nothing left for me to attain, no new journey, no horizon to chase.  I had done it.  And there was nothing left.\n\nI suppose challenge runs are still available to me, but never again can I step foot in Boletaria, Lordran, Drangleic, Lothric, or Yharnam without a strong sense of familiarity.  I will be forever trapped playing the same game over and over again, each time losing some of the magic that enraged and then entranced me.  From created something special in the Soulsborne series.   Something that others tried to imitate, still others crafted love letters in the form of games, but none have truly captured the magic that Dark Souls wove.\n\nIn the end, I suppose the Linking of the Flame endings represent how Miyazaki came to feel about the series; the first time, it was a grand flame, with strong hope for a magnificent future.  The second linking produced a somewhat smaller flame, but still brilliant and with faith in what was yet to come.  The third linking was tiny; I mean look at us, we barely even catch light.
