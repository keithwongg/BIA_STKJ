I paid the price for this knowledge in full."

They are a lie, the worst spacecraft vs spacecraft system I could have ever imagined.-Factions? They give you a minor discount on items, faction vs faction doesn't exist.-Survival? A pointless grind, the resource you need to survive is always nearby.-Adventure? More like exploration without any dangers.-Epic soundtrack? After 2 hours you will disable it and use your own music.-Achievements? Never before has earning achievements been annoying, they interrupt your gameplay.-Epic ending? It's the same as an empty box, there is nothing.-Reasons to buy this game?-No reason."

They also don't seem to become appreciably more interesting as you move towards the center, if at all. The pool of resources is shallow, and they're spread more or less homogeneously among planets. There are no objects on planets that you will not have seen in an hour or two on your first planet, and no objects in space that can be found through exploration. Explore should be renamed Sightsee, as that's more or less what you're doing when exploring because you quickly run out of significant things to discover.Fight:Ship combat was trivialized by the removal of classes and ship attributes. Large scale space battles were cut as well, and you cannot destroy space stations or freighters as we'd been told. You will fight sentinels and pirates alone, all of which fly ships which are functionally identical to your own. Ground combat occurs with only a few sentinels at a time, and poses no challenge. Fights are easily won, escaped from, or avoided entirely.Trade:Trading offers few benefits outside of selling valuable items to upgrade to better equipment. There are few items you'd actually ever want to buy from a trader, and few things to sell that are worth using an inventory slot on instead of a gold/emeril stack. Grinding for elements/rare items to sell is as far as most will ever go, and money quickly becomes useless in the game. You probably can't play as a space trader exclusively, and trading between systems doesn't seem worth the hassle even if you can. Trading with factions is a non-consideration as you will max out in rep for everyone very quickly. There simply isn't enough elements in the game to support deep trade, as there's little to actually need, and little worth actually selling.Survive:Everything you need for basic survival is bountiful on every planet. Sentinels pose no risk. The only thing that poses any particular risk is extreme planets, and there's zero incentive to even really visit those as they've got nothing you couldn't easily find elsewhere, not that the risk they pose isn't easily mitigated and/or dealt with.As you can see, the game we were told we'd get is a far more feature-rich, complex and dynamic game than the one we actually got. What we got was a static, lifeless and paper thin experience by comparison.I know I have played the game longer than the 2 hour refund peroid, but there was know way to know if any of these features we were sold on were in the game with out longer play time. As you can see I consistently played the game for those 18 hours when it was released. But I have not play it since after finding out all these features we were shown are missing.As well as the missing features there are also performance issues and random crashes of the game. My system specs are as follows.i7 2.67 GHz32GB RamNvidia GeForce GTX1070Windows 7 Professional 64bitI have been a long time Steam member for over 10 years and have a lot of games I have purchased from the platform in those years. This is the first one I have ever bought where I have felt cheated due to the misleading advertising of the game. I will seriously consider purchases with them Steam in future if the refund isn't resolved.I believe on these grounds I am entitled to a full refund.I am live in Netherlands and consumer law states I and entitled to a refund if:Does not match descriptions made by the salesperson, on packaging and labels, and in promotions or advertising."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 19, 2016              First of all, I really tried to like the game, and in all honesty, I do to a certain point. I pretty much achieved and did everything there is to do right now, the immersion is there, but everything else falls flat. This review is centered around the four cornerstones of the game.ExploreAs you may already know, the game procedurally generates a whole universe. This sounds, and is, awesome, but after a couple of systems you won't see anything special anymore. The planets are kind of the same and after a while you will know, if a planet will be worth it to land, or not. Landing on a garden world feels refreshing, but after two or three they too aren't that special anymore. The planetary physics are nonexistant. There are no gas giants, the sun is just a bright spot on a sky box, the planets aren't rotating, or moving at all. They are very close together which conveys a very unrealistic feeling.The plants and animals are also procedurally generated, but the pool is pretty limited and the animals' behaviour is also very limited. You can scan the animals to 'complete' a planet, but that's more a chore than fun.The real fun killer are the three space races, though. Every system has a station, every planet is inhabited by them, so every system is already kind of explored which actually contradicts the game's name itself.FightThe systems behind ground and space battle are, to put it mildly, shallow. The sentinels (the drones patrolling every planet) are just annoying and are canon fodder after some upgrades to your multi tool. Their stronger versions are destroyed with 2-3 shots of the same weapon. You still can just run away and your wanted level will be removed after a couple of seconds.The dogfights are just bad, plus they're only in space. Early on, space pirates are pretty much the only way you could die (I never died in this game) because they can pile up pretty quickly and your initial ship will suck at fighting back (more on ships later). With a good ship and some upgrades, they're just annoying again, otherwise you can just land on a planet or station and they will de-spawn. You have to recharge your shields manually in real time which isn't a good design decision.TradeThe trading system in No Man's Sky makes no sense at all. After just a couple of hours into the game, you will realize that units (the main currency) are pointless. The galactic trade market sells crafting materials and 'rare' items on a very limited scale and you're better off farming them for yourself. Selling things is also pretty much useless, unless you want to buy a new ship, but they are horrendously overpriced. Finding crashed ships on planets is way easier, cheaper and faster to get you a new ride. Crafting consumable items isn't worth your time because you can refuel your space suit and engines with the raw materials. Also, consumables and rare items aren't stackable which results in a very limited inventory (which is already limited in itself).Speaking of the inventory. Getting a bigger inventory is just a carrot on a stick. You can upgrade your suit with more inventory slots (the only place where your units are not pointless) and new ships have a chance to have more slots than your current one. So you will be interested in upgrading your stuff, which gives you something to do. But. With everything upgraded to the maximum, half of the existing crafting materials aren't needed anymore. The result is that you upgraded your inventory just to upgrade your inventory. After that, all the space isn't needed anymore and the needed crafting resources can be found on every single planet.SurviveAs I wrote earlier in 'Fight', the combat part of survival is very shallow, so are the more passive things in No Man's Sky. Most of the planets have a certain hostility modifier, like hot, cold, toxic and radioactive. The problem here is that as soon as you get behind the mechanics, it's very avoidable by just entering a building, caves or your ship to recharge your protection level, and you can do it manually, too. Again, with a properly upgraded space suit, hostile environments are pretty much nonexistent in the end game.Rare resources are paired with more hostile sentinels, see 'Fight'.Anything ElseEdit 28/08/16: Hello Games released some minor patches for most of the performance issues. I leave the outdated stuff below in brackets because it was important to me at that point. The fixes won't change my decision to not recommend the game.I don't want to comment the launch problems of the game because there are plenty other reviews out there already describing the problems.Outdated: (The performance problems shouldn't be there, and after two patches my game still crashes sometimes. Other problems, like FPS drops when entering your ship, aren't fixed yet.)I know that my play time shows that I had my fair share for my money, but I still think that 60â¬ was a bit too much. 30-40â¬ would have been okay for what you'll get.You will like the game when- you like farming for farming's sake- you just want to chill out and relax- going on interstellar sightseeing tour is your thingYou won't like the game when- you get bored quickly by repetitive content- you want to have a in depth trading or fighting system- you like realistic simulation- building stuff is important to you"

It had extremely negative feedback and felt like a scam after all of the hype and buildup to those of us who preordered. These facts are what make this game so impressive today. After constant fixes, patches, and 12 huge free updates, this game is extraordinary and one of my favorites by far. And the free updates, which add dozens of hours of new content each, only keep coming. My hat is off to the amazing development team at Hello Games for listening to the community and showing that not all game developers are solely in it for the money. Thanks again for this wonderful masterpeice."

It's able to sell because the game at heart has a great idea, and the devs and publisher know how to market it. The question is if you would pay $60 for an idea or a game. If you buy No Man's Sky, all you'll get is the former. If you're looking for the game, you won't find it here. They will tell you that you're buying the game (just look at these trailers and screenshots) but it's not. It's deceptive, disgusting, and borderline fraud, but it's business. Only purchase if you have faith in Hello Games, even after they lied to you."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 21, 2018              So here's the thing...All things considered, No Man's Sky is a good game. I think it's a great game, but my tastes are veeerry specific.NMS filled a desire I've had for a VERY long time. I just wanted to simply fly and walk around planets in a game that wasn't as artistically dry as, say, Elite Dangerous, or as simplistic and railroaded as Spore.That's all it needed to impress me, but it has done so much more than that.I think there is enough here now after all the updates, especially the upcoming NEXT patch, for a typical sci-fi fan to get a good kick out of.In No Man's Sky, you'll be spending a lot of your time:1. Collecting materials to sell off, craft, or fuel up your equipment, among other things.2. Building a base and doing missions to unlock more building parts and items from your base NPCs.3. Flying around space. Protip: this is a good time to manage your inventory.4. Accepting faction missions and trading at space stations.5. Interacting with NPCs who may give you rewards for solving their problems or doing what they ask.6. Collecting words of alien languages to help you understand the NPCs problems better.7. Exploring, just in general. It's nice to just kick back and wander sometimes.8. Finding upgrades: better multitools, exosuit tech, ships, vehicles, and upgrades to install into each of them.9. Shooting at pirates, sentinels, and very ugly animals.10. Progressing through the  Atlas Rises  story missions.11. Trying (and in my case failing) to save up money for a bigass freighter, which you can also build a base in.12. Trying (and most assuredly failing) to 100% catalog the species of a planet for a big money bonus.13. Uploading and optionally renaming your discovered planets and lifeforms for cash.14. Raiding buildings on planets for useful junk or coordinates to other useful junk.14 1/2. Probably more I forgot about?That's the basic overview, but... I really want to address something important.This game was indeed overhyped, but at the same time, was also overcriticized at the beginning, understandably so given the information at the time.But the truth is, there's more nuance to what happened than  Sean tricked us into buying an unfinished game. Considering the hard work they've been putting into these free updates over the last couple of years, the idea that Sean was intentionally trying to scam people doesn't quite add up. And it would seem that my first guess as to what really happened was pretty much true.Sean Murray is a passionately ambitious dev, but isn't exactly a PR and marketing pro. And that worked against him, tragically.According to a recent interview, Sean Murray claims that he was not really prepared to properly and carefully consider his messaging during pre-release interviews and gameplay videos where certain features were detailed that didn't make it to the release build. It was obvious that he loved what he was making and naively wanted to share his complete vision with future players, but was not clear about what was going on in development at the time, and in what state these features were in.Some of those features were being worked on, but didn't quite make it to release due to budget and time crunch problems.Some of those features simply never made it even though they appeared in early trailers, like sand worms. Possibly due to bugs or gameplay issues, as that's why most cool features get cut before a release.One key example is multiplayer. Before release, HG had been working on the barebones floating orb multiplayer feature we now have currently. The nature of this  multiplayer  lines up with what Sean vaguely described in interviews.However, HG was simply not able to wrap up development of the multiplayer feature, and had to push it back.Now... none of this *really* excuses releasing a game that is missing promised (or implied) features.But what I can say is that it's clear to me that there was nothing malicious or greedy behind the situation HG put themselves in. They had a PR crisis. A particularly bad one, the reaction to which I think was unwarranted considering what we know now.This narrative that Hello Games was out to scam people is not only a silly notion considering their dedication to continuing work on the game, but it unnecessarily drives people away from an experience they may actually enjoy if they were to get past the development drama. It has become so pervasive that even people who have never even played or looked at footage of the game are now parroting hyperbolic nonsense that it had the worst launch of all time and that it was a giant scam. This is a frustrating case of bandwagoning.By continuously working on NMS, and adding large swaths of content with every expansion, HG has shown me, through their actions, not words, that they are not the bad-faith actors they are made out to be.I can certainly forgive the mishandling of the hype and launch considering what we'll be getting in just a couple days with NEXT.With that in mind, I am not angry with HG or Sean, nor was I even disappointed with the initial release. I played it. I liked it. It was repetitive, sure, but it was unique and aesthetically striking.I just wish they would've communicated more effectively initially. If I went through what they went through, I don't know if I would've had the strength to continue. Though maybe the backlash put a fire under HG'sâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to prove the naysayers wrong.Who knows...The TL;DR is: If someone has convinced you that No Man's Sky is some kind of horrible, hugely disappointing game, that may be their real opinion, but they are almost certainly exaggerating for the thrill of exacting righteous fury on a perceived sleight.I encourage you to look more objectively into what NMS is and whether it is the right game for you. It may very well not be. But you don't need to feel guilty about buying a game from a supposedly unethical dev. That just ain't how it is.Addendum (July 25th, 2018): The NEXT update is now available. After my time with it so far, and after having read through the changelist, I am beyond impressed. I was already cautiously optimistic for it, but this feels and looks like an entirely new game. It is as if they have transformed it into its own sequel... if that makes any sense. There are too many changes to list, much less choose to focus on here, so see them for yourself on the official website.There are a few weird bugs they need to iron out as of this writing, but nothing major.Considering the current half-off sale and the new expansion, I can confidently say that this may be the perfect time to get into No Man's Sky. This is the game in a form that really lives up to its potential. And what's exciting, is that there's apparently even more on the way.I really could not be more pleased.But Sean, please fix my Korvax's face-screen!"

They could have updated the game only through paid DLC. But they didn't. Instead, they have set themselves the task of realising what I assume was their original vision, before it was completely derailed by the hype train. And they are making it available to all buyers for free, including the upcoming multiplayer patch.The game itself still isn't perfect. Its grindy, somewhat simplistic and saddled with what is probably one of the worst inventory systems I have ever had the misfortune to use. At the same time though, it genuinely rewards exploration and doles out intriguing snippets of backstory across multiple plot threads. Together, these aspects prevent the game from sinking into a mire of generic procedural generation. There is always one more thing to do; build a new base, buy a new ship, visit a new planet type, craft a new item. Even after over a hundred hours I still haven't purchased a freighter. Rather than rush, I have whiled away the hours cruising between planets, seeing the sights and deciding how I want to shape the galaxy.HG have finally earned the asking price.EDIT: Since I reviewed this, there have been three major content updates, all free."

I have fully explored several planets, maxed out inventories and travelled accross countless star systems. I spent hours simply building up language database. Do you know what i have to show for it? Nothing. it was a waste of time.To be clear, this is a beautiful looking game, with lot's of hope and wonder, that leads to absolutely nothing. I spent hours building up resources and inventories and amassing fortunes. With nothing to do with it. All that time spent learning languages, and there was no point. Anything important story-wise, is in common language. I had much hope, waiting for something to happen. It didn't. You build random items and fuels, but that's it. You can only move from one place to another, and very little changes. Buildings are virtually identical and evenly distributed on EVERY planet. You can spot them and know exactly what they are, and what they will contain. They are unbelieveably generic. Every NPC is the same. I spent hours learning languages of a particular race. 20+ building oup relations of 1 of the 3 races, so much so i was able to decipher almost the entire language in every dialogue. Do you know what I discovered? That it didn't matter. As soon as I discovered the 2nd race, it didn't matter that I didn't know a single word. They were identical. Sure they looked different a little, but every interaction was identical. There is no point to any of the languages, they amount to nothing at all. By the time you get enough to start deciphering the exact words, what they have to say is entirely useless anyway. Did you like that outpost you were at? Too bad, you'll never find it again because navigation is terrible. But don't worry, it doesn't matter because there is another outpost that is identical, just jump in your ship and fly in any direction for less than a minute and you'll find the same damn place with a different name.This game was like the ending of the TV Show  Lost , lots of buildup for a complete let down. Accumulate for no reason, talk for no reason, explore for no reason. I like a grind, but you don't even have anything to show for it. You'll never go back to wherever you were, and you'll never be able to share what you find with another human being. Cool, on this planet I'm going to name everything after memes. cool. What's the point? I'll never see that planet again when i leave for the next one. I gave this game far too much of a chance, and too much of my time. Go play minecraft, at least here you can build something. Play an MMO, at least there you can talk to someone. Go play a game with any form of campaign, at least you'll get a story. NMS is like all those games, without the things that make them great. No story, no meaningful building, no social. This feels entirely like an MMO that is empty. Accumulate wealth to buy nothing of worth, to quest with no one, and find nothing of note."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 5, 2016              As both a gamer and someone who runs an agile development team in real life, I can say that I'm thoroughly upset at the half-baked product that Sean Murray and Hello Games released.  I wanted to convey a few thoughts as to what drives this angry feeling: 1) over-promising and under-delivering:  Regardless of the size of your studio and their development capabilities, you have a fundamental duty to your users to accurately depict what you're creating for them.  Sean and co. did not do that. They promised a full, complex universe that emulates what it would be like to traverse worlds, planets, and star systems. What they sold was a two simulators slap-dashed together and stuffed with a random attribute generator. If this is a universe emulator, it's a really depressing one that's more of a soul-less minecraft knock-off with crappy crafting and a sub-par space/flight sim bolted on. The lack of multiplayer was especially a drag, but given how little you can actually do in the universe, I'm not sure it would have materially added to the experience. The NPC development was also laughably sub-par.The joy of discovery wears really thin when there's nothing of note to discover.  2) The in-game UI:  Did they not do any play-testing whatsoever?  The interface is infuriating. the long-clicks, the insanely long, not-skippable transitions to talk to NPC's, the inventory management- all of it.  It's some of the worse UI I've seen in a game. 3) the lack of communication from HG/Sean:  There's two things that can act as a multiplier for gamer outrage: the price paid for the game, and the extent to which the developers stop communicating after releasing a broken game.  At current count, it's been 48 days since Sean Murray communicated anything at all to the users. There's simply no excuse for that. That's especially true when you look at the economics of the game realase: at least 750,000 copies sold at $60 a pop. They released an early access game at a AAA price point, and effectively stopped communicating with their user base (aside from resolving some critical usability bugs). This studio took in at least $45 million in revenue for a broken game, and then stopped communicating with its users. I've spent a fair amount of time playing the game, partially because i wanted to give it a fair shot, and because i gave in to some of the grindy game dynamics for a while. Yes, it can generate some decent screenshots, but overall It's not satisfying, it's not fulfilling, and it's a frustrating experience to see an entire broken universe created without any meaning to it. No Man's Sky is as expansive as it is shallow and broken."

I sank a couple hours in here and there, but I just couldn't get into it. The story felt dull, the landscapes were just... off, and it just wasn't what was advertised.I cast it aside, too late to refund.Base building came out, along with vehicles, creative mode, and a camera. I played around with them, and they were fun - but the survival still felt lackluster. Creative mode got boring fast, and the camera (probably one of my favourite game features at the time) was hardly worth going into the game to use just for screenshots.And now, after the Waking Titan ARG - we have Atlas Rises.To be honest - I'm impressed. Suddenly, I find myself wanting to play survival because it's fun. Hell, I find myself wanting to play the game itself because I enjoy it now, not because I'm bored and need to sink time into something. The story is interesting and I want to see more, dozens of tiny little things that weren't there suddenly are...It's a new experience.In all honesty, I would have much preferred to see the game in this state on release. That way I would have been spared a year of disappointment. Hello Games has done what few developers would have done after the disaster of the release, and has spent time and effort making this game into something they can be proud of. It's clear they believe in the potential of No Man's Sky, and I find that inspiring.I can finally, in good conscience, recommend this game.I think the price is still too steep - but I would recommend it on half price."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 28, 2016              The game creates the illusion that it is going somewhere for a few hours and then begins to become a grind... which works for a lot of titles. The grind can be welcome. Look at Minecraft, MMOs, Warframe and even games with ranked matches. People love to grind to improve, or collect or move forward. That is not what I am talking about when I talk about NMS.The grind in NMS is a grind without reason or goal. You simply exist to repeat the same pointless acts until you get bored... the reason there is such a tidal wave of rage is because you get sick of this 60+ dollar game extremely quickly.Pros: Reading up on the lore for the races is interesting.Cons: I didn't pay 60 dollars for a comic book length read about 3 alien races.Space combat is terrible and feels like it was never tested.Where are the goals?No end game.No mid game.Creatures are all frankenstein combinations of the same parts. Scanning birds is buggy and doesn't react fast enough. General advice is to just kill them and scam the corpse.Worlds are ugly and garish due random asset dumping without thought or care.It is designed to be a timesink and only a timesink. Your money is better spent elsewhere.If you absolutely feel the need to buy this, try to stop playing before 2 hours and really contemplate if it is worth keeping... they didn't put up a  we don't offer refunds outside of the rules  warning sticker on the store page for a while for no reason. This game looks and plays nothing like advertised and worse than that, barely functions as a game. Maybe if it sold for 20USD it could be justified... maybe. 1/10 refund simulator, stops working if you leave it on too long while googling when the fun is supposed to start."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 17, 2018              No Man's Sky...is an exploration and crafting survival game. Waking up on an unknown planet with no memory of your past and a crashed spacecraft with cryptic or fragmentary information, you set out to survive the environment and explore the Euclid Galaxy one planet at the time, as you define your purpose. This review takes into account the NEXT update.â Game Description & Mechanics âGameplay is focused on gathering resources and crafting objects. You begin with a basic multitool and limited inventory space, and learn to mine for crafting material to fix your equipment and recharge your life-support and hazard protection shields. As you progress, you'll learn recipes to more advanced components to build devices, refine basic elements, craft equipment upgrades for your multitool, exosuit and spacecraft, and even build a base (or multiple bases).Much of No Man's Sky revolves around exploring and cataloguing all you discover. Scanning each mineral, flora and fauna found on each planet will identify the resource it supplies as well as give you Units (trade currency) for each you scan for the first time, while uploading them to the servers will give you Nanite Clusters (tech currency). Units can be used to purchase material and components from the Galactic Trade Network, as well as better multitools, spacecrafts and frigates. Nanite Clusters are used to purchase equipment blueprints and upgrade modules. As the galaxy is shared among all players, you get to name any system, planet, waypoint, animal or plant you're the first player to scan, forever leaving your mark in the game for the next player to fly by this system and land on the planet.Progression is done in multiple ways. After the introduction (which also serves as a tutorial), you can follow the Path of Atlas which sets you to eventually reach the center of the galaxy. You may instead set your focus on the single-player campaign where you retrace the footsteps of another Traveller like you. Of course, you can ignore both options and advance at your own pace, finding alternative ways to unlock the game's content. For instance, you can unlock base building component blueprints from burried salvage technologies and from side-missions given to you by your in-base specialists. Once you have a freighter, your crew will give you missions for your fleet of frigates (which you send on exploration, trading or combat missions). Those seeking a bigger challenge can do all that in Survival or Permadeath modes.âº What I enjoyed âºIt's hard to express just how much there is to do in this game! In the early game, your limited equipment and inventory space will force you to struggle through a slow progression, but the entry grind has a satisfaction of its own once you acquire additional cargo space to store spare consumable and specialized material, upgrade your multitool and exosuit with a variety of weapon modules, better shields, enhanced environmental protection and various specialized equipment. Once you accumulate a good reserve of Units, trading your spacecraft for a bigger, stronger or faster one will only accelerate the process.Base building is also very satisfying if you're into this. You can build anywhere, and the base's size cap is very high. The base can serve as headquarters with additional storage space, a farm to produce rare material, a gathering place for you and up to 3 of your friends (the base itself can be built as a team), build racing tracks for use with your exocrafts (land vehicles you can, of course, build and upgrade!) and then upload it to the online servers or the Steam Workshop. Getting a freighter (from which you control your fleet and store multiple spacecrafts) serves as a mobile base of its own, part of which you can alter and build in to your liking.It's a gorgeous game, the constant updates since launch brought improvements to textures, procedural generation algorithms and overall graphical technology upgrades. The quantity of biomes allows quite the diversity: dry and dusty deserts, cold and icy snow plains, lush and humid forests, barren and rocky landscapes, foggy and poisonous fungal plains, to name a few, and I'm leaving out some of the most obscure, eccentric or over-the-top planets you can find in red star, green star and blue star systems. New creature types, from small to humongous, can be found on these, once again proceedurally-generated from head to toe, with actual per-planet coherence.â¹ What bothered me â¹As mentioned before, it's a game about about resource-gathering and crafting. This means a lot of grind, hour upon hour of mining and refining your resources. Want to build a huge base? Grind for building material. Want to make a lot of money? Grind for valuable resources. Want to survive a hostile environment? Grind for life support and environmental protection fuel. If you don't enjoy this kind of stuff, you will find it terribly tedious. The change of pace from story missions, base building missions and sidequest missions is limited as they can also feel very repetitive, even with the efforts made by the developers with the week-long community events.PvP and PvE combat mechanics, whether on the ground or in space, are less than optimal. The ingredients all appear to be there: various weapon types and grenades for ground, various weapon types and missiles for space, the run/strafe/jump mechanics, yet somehow it still feels off and doesn't even come close to games dedicated to either types of combat. So while you  can  be a pirate and fight frigates, or you  can  be a hunter fighting predators and sentinels, it's barely worth the trouble and seems to have been included as an afterthought. The single-player campaign is somewhat simple and feels like a goose chase of travelling from one location to another, grinding, digging or building specific upgrades to continue to the next clue. Learning the alien languages, one word at a time, has little payoff. Most of the galaxy lore, given through snippets of history found in monoliths or conversations with stationary NPCs, will feel superficial to anyone who doesn't want to do the roleplaying in his head. If you can't set your own objectives and strictly rely on the fun of exploring, you will start seeing repeating patterns in the procedural generation of planets' flora and fauna as soon as you've been on a couple of systems.My Verdict: âââââ -  Next on your list! No Man's Sky isn't a space combat simulator, nor a sci-fi adventure: it is first and foremost an exploration and crafting survival game, in the veins of ARK: Survival Evolved (although the multiplayer isn't quite there, yet) and Subnautica. However, a lot of people are looking for a game that does just that. You'll find a lot to do, it isn't even humanly possible to discover the entire galaxy (even if all players worked together in an attempt to do so). With all the updates so far and those to come, it definitely delivers!P.S.: I was lucky enough to avoid the pre-launch hype, but I do understand the disappointment and frustration caused by Hello Games' marketing, promising features that wouldn't actually make it in the game until years from launch. And while I can appreciate the dedication of the team not to have run away with the money and actually delivering on their promises, I can't forget nor forgive that easily, and you can be sure I'll never pre-purchase anything this studio releases.âââââââââââââââââââââââââThis was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews."

The developers said that, upon release, the game would have a whole lot of bells and whistles, that ended up not existing in this game. I have never refunded anything on Steam before, so I thought I might get a little leniency having put 11 hours into it. (I'll grant you 2 hours is 2 hours, but I needed to see for myself if there really is anything more.  This was within the 14-day period. And after I tried refunding it, I haven't played it since. But no such luck.) Moral of the story is, buyer beware, don't be the first of the first to try a product. Especially not in todays gaming marketplace. More likely than not you'll end up with a steamy log of false promises.Don't buy this unless you're prepared to be disappointed.PS I'll return to this game in a while and see if the developers make good on their promises, and i'll revise this review to reflect that."

I want to keep exploring because planets have CLASSES now. I fell into a cave that was filled with water. I flew over giant oceans and huge continents, and I haven't even ventured outside a starting solar system yet.With each update, the game becomes more like a first person Starbound and I LOVE IT.NEXT Update:YES. YES. GOOD SALESGEK ALMIGHTY YES.So I have to say, I'm a fan of all the changes. I do see this update still as a foundation tho, which many seem to gloss over. This sets up a solid Mulitplayer foundation. I can be a Gek. Solid new building mechanics. I can be a Gek. World Gen keeps getting better and better. I can be a Gek. Even better tweaked progression... AND I CAN COMMAND A FLEET OF FRIGATES WHILE BEING A GEK."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 17, 2017              The fact that this title is still $60 says a lot about the ethics of Hello Games. The blatant lies told by the devs and the use of pre-rendered footage passed of as  actual gameplay  prior to release. The continuation of lies after the game was released. Yeah, they're adding new content (small amounts of it), but too little too late. It was a cleverly disguised sham of a game that took you around 4 hours to dig below the thin surface to find out what you thought you bought was nowhere near what you received, allowing both Hello Games and Steam to skirt the refund policy. Quite possibly one of the worst game puchases I've ever made in 30 years of gaming."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 23, 2016              Edit: Review is constantly changed as I keep finding more reasons to write about why people should stay away from this game.The reason for my 40+ hours in this game is because like many other players, I kept playing hoping for the game to get better. Unfortunately, it never did.It is essentially the most basic of survival games with little to no features or content. Most players' first few hours are as follows.1. Find yourself stranded on a planet wondering where you are.2. Go out looking for resources to repair your ship.3. Find the atmosphere of the game amazing.4. Potentially find one of the (ONLY THREE!) alien races and be even more amazed.5. Repair ship and head to space.6. Go to space station.7. (Wow more of) The alien race, cool.8. Go to another planet, see same thing for miles on end.9. Head to another system.10. Potentially find different planet or same planet as first system with a different colour palette.After this, the novelty wears off, and that's when the tedium and monotony ensues for most players.1. Find plutonium, recharge launch thrusters.2. Maybe stay at the current system's station and trade between some of the aliens.3. Life support low every minute, (TECHNOLOGIES, RECHARGED!).4. Maybe find one of the less than ten worthwhile resources to gather on a planet.5. Mine for hours on end.6. Make antimatter, go to another system.7. Rinse and repeat.Hint: ^ This part goes on forever.The gimmick behind No Man's Sky is purely exploration, and that can't exist as each one of the 3 alien races seems to occupy every bit of the galaxy divided amongst themselves, which doesn't allow you to have any sense of discovery or accomplishment for finding certain things that may exist on the planets or within the systems. Every single building looks the same between the 3 races and the procedural generation can create some rather, disappointing creations when it comes to the creatures such as a bouncing pineapple with eyes. Put this across 18 quintillion planets, that of which all will never be discovered, and you essentially have a game in which nothing may as well exist because that is exactly what you're doing. The company invested more time and money in an alogrithm, rather than producing something of a higher quality that may have been worth our hard earned cash.Also some players have had their discoveries reset or deleted since the beginning of the game (about 2 weeks later, in chronological order). Even more points against the supposed  discovery  and  exploration  aspects of the game.For those of you wondering about the 40+ hours and how I could ever possibly think it could get better, it's because the developers lied about that too. From several interviews, we were told that the closer you got to the center, the  crazier  the procedural generation became. Nothing changed, not from going as far out as possible, or going as far in as possible. NOTHING CHANGED! ZERO! It was the same planet types, the same  hazardous  environments and atmospheres, the same horrible creature generation with the only difference being colour. The limited amount of variations in such a large system causes this game to become incredibly repetitive in all aspects of gameplay very quickly.One of the recent patches also forced new players to require even larger amounts of time in order to reach the center, as these new players spawn further out from the center than those prior to the patch, and distance travelled between systems seems to have been divided by ~4. Attempts to reach the center are purposefully being impeded/stalled as to prevent players from witnessing one of the worst  endings  to a game possible (where we were told it was supposed to be  magical  and  beautiful , which the  ending  is the exact opposite of).The main  enemies  of this game aren't even worth mentioning either. They're barely a threat, give large quantities of titanium (a RARE material), and of course, are on every single planet, in every single system, in every single galaxy, in the universe. They can also be a nuissance on some planets where they are also automatically aggressive when they see you. They can attack you while talking to an alien or when examining a monolith, while you have to wait for lines of text to come up, before you can cancel it to defend yourself. They can kill you during actions which you can not control past the initiation of.As stated by many, this  game  is a tech demo and nothing more as of the release. Even now it still runs poorly on some of the best hardware one can have in their computer. It's also a hand holder along with overly simple flight mechanics, god awful UI, and inventory system.It's sad to think that the hype around this game was actually produced more by the main developer of Hello Games (Sean Murray for those who don't know), and that they disappointed far too many people to count. It's discouraging to see that with how many features were promised, how full of life the trailers and interviews made the game seem, we got the most stripped down version of the game possible, where even Minecraft has more to offer, and that's a sandbox.What's worse is that the Steam store is currently showing two trailers which are referenced for the false advertising of the game. Customers are potentially viewing content which is not present in the game, which either will never exist, or may be added far too long down the road. Along with this, the trailers show far better graphics (even on the highest settings) and shows the game running far smoother than it does. To add insult to injury, the features and content shown in the trailers may even come out as paid DLC, putting what was once promised content behind another pay wall. If it's anything like the base game, the developers are likely to be labeled as frauds, if they haven't already.It is unclear as to whether the developers plan on adding the features they have left from the game based on the interviews and trailers, or even plan on bothering to communicate with those who purchased the game.TL;DR: An inadequate game with inadequate support followed by terrible pricing.P.S. This game is not worth buying on sale either, even a 50% discount would not be worth the price to time ratio, considering most people are interested in the game for about 8-10 hours.P.P.S. This should be the one game on steam you can refund with less than 50 hours, because by that time you might actually reach the center of the galaxy (your  mission  apparently), and you will realize what a waste of time and money this game was/is."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 22, 2016              Let me preface everything by saying that I actually bought this game on impulse before watching the trailers.  I like space, I like exploration, some of the early reviews were positive, so I bought it.  I regret that impulsive decision.      Take it from a 5 year veteran of Eve: Online this game is BORING.  Imagine Eve minus the hordes of players trying to kill you, it's more boring than that.    There is supposed to be septillions of stars and planets generated, but their algorithm is poor. This results in maybe 12 different planet types and 30 animal species. I'm being very generous with the planets, for the most part they are just different colors with a different icon showing you what is killing you today.  Now I wasn't expecting Spore like creature variety, but this is insulting. All of them look the same. There might be some slight variation between the crab like species trying to kill me, but I honestly couldn't tell. The entire game is far too easy, in my trek from the start to the center of the galaxy my shields dropped a total of maybe 10 times, I still don't know what the death screen looks like.   The interface is utterly terrible. You have to hold to click EVERYTHING. I cannot fathom a reason this has to be for literally EVERYTHING. The galaxy map is the single worst aspect of the UI, a rather galaring flaw for something that wants to do space exploration. The path to the center is utterly useless, as I got close to the center it literally got stuck in a dead end. It ignores your hyperdrive upgrades meaning it's course will take you through about a dozen short hops and then abruptly stop, while you can reach the end in one jump or infact go much futher. There is a total disconnect between  Distance from Center  and  Linear Distance , 500ly for the former is about 1,500ly for the latter. You are down to luck for finding any particular location, even ones you've visited before.    The game play is more or less a resource grind, you land on a planet, shoot at a rock with a mining laser, you leave the planet to go shoot at a different rock. There are NPC, they are of three races, all of which just stand or sit alone in one place. They never do anything, you can talk to them and maybe get a blue print or something, but thats it, there is no personality, not even real interaction.  There was an Atlas quest line, that brought you to 10 admittedly rather spiffy looking space stations. Actually I lied, there are 4 rather spiffy looking space stations that are repeated a couple of times in no particular order. It starts no where and ends in a non ending. This may last you a couple of hours (or however long it takes you to realize the map system is trash and just jump to the end). But it pales in comparison to reaching the Galactic Center.  Thats the final insult, what happens at the center. I'll rant in a spoilerific manner after the next paragraph. Suffice to say if we reached the center and had a planet sized MIDDLE FINGER to explore, this would still be less of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU than what we got. Because at least the Flipping Bird of God would be an object of interest and discussion.      It was after I had played for a while that I went out and watched the trailers, holyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I wanted to play that game, too bad it's not what I bought. I'm angry I wasted money buying this, I would have been furious if my expectations were that high. This isn't a case of a fandom hyping in a vacuum, the developers were outright lying to us. Not just in the trailers, but in the words they were speaking. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERYou start jumping to the center, the game silently says  nope , plays prog rock as it holds the scroll backwards button on the map screen, fade to black and dumps you at the start of a new practically identical galaxy with all you stuff broken. I think it might even have gotten the color on my ship wrong. I can't tell because my game bugged out and put me in slow mo, and I was already fighting the urge to just toss my computer out a window. So no, you don't even get to see what is so shiny at the center of the universe, you just start over again.     Seriously â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game."

After all the pre-release hype and excitement, No Mans Sky was surely to become the best game ever made? Turns out, it wasn't. Stuff that was supposed to be in it, wasn't.So, perhaps you were like me, you held off from buying it.  Well, that was a total let down  you said to yourself. But then, that changed when the  NEXT  update came out, along with a 50% discount. You read about it, you took a gamble and you bought it.Then perhaps, you are like me and you are happy that you did take that gamble. What you get with No Mans Sky is a truly open world space exploration and discovery game with survival elements. Fly your ship across multiple systems, finding and discovering new planets, each with their own ecosystems and unique species, collect resources, sell resources, buy resources, research new technologies, build a base, build more than one base, hook up with friends and visit their bases, buy some new ships, complete the main story missions, embark on some side missions, cruise around space like you don't have a care in the world, swim in the oceans, go cave diving, go hiking, shoot some sentinels, the list literally goes on.NMS is a gorgeous game to look at, and it runs nicely with a i5 4690k / 1060. It's got an excellent soundtrack too. Controls are nice, and inventory management works well.A minor gripe include what feels to be a limited pool of plant and creature species that the game generates from. However, I understand that is being addressed with another update.A rather larger gripe that I have with NMS is a bug whereby you may not be connected to the Discovery Services, and a friend comes into your game and discovers a planet that you thought you had already discovered, only find next time you login they discovered it. That's super annoying for me, but due to how incredible this game is, it's a bug I'm willing to forgive...for now.Overall, NMS is a huge game which continues to get updated by the developers, and credit to Hello Games - they stuck at it, didn't let the initial negative reaction put them off from cracking on with the game, and I'm super happy that they did. Well done team.Or perhaps, you're not like me, and you're still not convinced with NMS. If you're not, that's a shame - you are missing out.Highly recommended."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 16, 2016              In light of the Steam Autumn sale and the Steam Awards, I nominate this game for The  Full of Lies  award.http://www.gamezone.com/news/no-man-s-sky-founder-backtracks-could-get-paid-dlc-3442515Sean Murray promised there would be no paid DLC, we would recieve free updates since we had already paid $60 for the game. That was last week. Looks like that's already changed as Sean has gone back on that and said that Paid DLC is possible.https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4wxydf/im_about_to_meet_another_player_seriously/https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4y1h9i/wheres_the_no_mans_sky_we_were_sold_on_a_big_list/https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4y046e/wheres_the_nms_we_were_sold_on_heres_a_big_list/The original thread was unpinned and deleted, not sure why. Added a repost on /r/games and there is a cached version of the original in the comments.Sean Murray promised there would be multiplayer but it would be very difficult to find one another. Soon after the game launched two streamers met up at the same place at the same time and could not see each other. The game is singleplayer. Sean has been very vague about everything since the begining and we're starting to know why. Above is a list showing the content that was planned and what is shown is an entirely different No Man's Sky. The game is not what they have promised and it not what was shown pre-launch or at E3. As you will read in many of the reviews, to many this game is not worth $60. No Man's Sky has a lot of good and can definitely be enjoyable. At it's core it is a great space exploration game that I could see myself enjoying for many more hours but the content that currently exists in the game is closer to $20-$30.The PC port is a complete mess that a very large amount of people have significant performance problems, including myself, such as very low FPS, significant stuttering and hitching, and dropping to less than a third of your average FPS after an hour of play until restarting the game. Many can't even play the game. The resolution option does not change the resolution as the in game resolution is a set sub 1080p resolution (nobody knows the exact resolution from what I can tell) and is upscaled. Every graphics option other than FPS limit and FOV require a restart. Some graphics features aren't changeable such as chromatic abberation, any LOD or view distance settings, ambient occlusion, and anisotropic filtering doesn't work. There are control bindings that don't exist for mouse and keyboard as well such as free cam as a pilot.The player count average has dropped from over 200,000 to about 30,000-50,000 within the first week of launch. This is likely because the gameplay consists of mining resources from a planet to reach the next planet to mine resources in addition to the many performance and stability problems.https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4xfrgb/defending_bad_pc_launches_ruins_the_future_of_pc/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_video_game_developmentPlease do not defend the developers because they are indie, are a small studio, or because  games have launch issues.  First off, they have had significant financial support from Sony Entertainment Studios which brings into debate whether or not they're actually an indie studio. Secondly, if you are going to charge full price $60 for a product, it is reasonable to expect that product would have the content of a full priced game as well as work like one. Some say that the game is not complete and we should have known that going in. No Man's Sky released as a finished title for a full $60. A Full release is a full release will be treated like a full release. If you are considering buying No Man's Sky I encourage you to wait until either Hello Games gets theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥together or the community does it for them and pick it up at $30 or less price point.[Edits --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------]If you find errors or wrong information in my review, let me know, but ONLY if you provide valid evidence. Before we start an angry mob I want to get something straight. I don't think we should start grabbing the pitchforks quite yet and I didn't make this review to make Sean Murray the devil. I come off a tad aggressive because yeah, they should be held accountable for their actions and it's pretty disappointing when something like this happens. However, I think it's very possible Sean and his team could have been in a very difficult situation where they really didn't have a right answer. He always seems anxious and stressed during interviews. Being in a 15 man team behind such an ambitious project with hype levels we haven't seen in awhile, partially because of Sony's marketing, it's understandable. It's also possible that when you invole a third party some power over the project is lost. Things are rarely black and white. Consider the situation on the other side of all of this before we go demonizing anyone. I think we should give No Man's Sky and Hello Games a few weeks to see where things go, see how they react to and handle the situation and let them show their true colors.Though the majority of the list displaying the lack of content seems to be true, there is another post that is showing that a few parts are not, specifically planet terrain features, plant life, and some animal life. That still leaves many features missing but it can also mean it has not been experienced yet. https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4y0fbx/just_because_you_personally_have_not_seen/"

Clunky inventory system, lack of interesting goals, massive in scope but feels soulless and empty, gathering materials and traveling is a chore etc. Not sure what I was expecting but the game would be way better with only a handful of planets that were crafted with love and purpose. Now it's just travelling from generic sphere 35935 to generic sphere 25836 and wondering what is the purpose of anything - maybe that's what the reality of space exploration is but it sure is dull. Clearly not a game for everyone and especially not for me, but if it was priced at 19.99â¬~ with no technical shortcomings or false pretenses, then I'd be more willing to give it a pass but now it's just an overpriced and badly handled mess."

Kudos Hello Games for not letting this great game fade away.Try it, for me is a 10/10."

But this has brought it all back to me I'm afraid to say.Where to start?I'm watching the trailer above while I write this and I'm staggered by the sheer audacity of the Devs. There are a lot of things in both trailers on steam that are either absent from the game completly or impossible to actualy accomplish.I'm not going to go over the vast list of missing features here. Theres too many. WAY too many. I can try howeverto describe whats wrong with what IS in there.There is the dull and boring plot/story, the infuriating flight controls and the terible graphics. Theres the simplistic, grinding crafting system and the complete lack of any trading system or economy. Theres the terrible galactic map that doesnt allow you to even search for names or places, let alone tell you anything about what resources a system or planet has on it without actually landing and taking a stroll. Finding your way back to somewhere you've been is almost impossible, even if you know the name of the system. But theres no trade so why would you want to I guess?I was expecting a degree of combat both space and land based and although it is present it does not present any challenge at all.I've already got the biggest ship, the largest suit inventory and the best multi tool. So I have no reason at all to craft anything ever again it seems.What was the point of upgrading anyway? There are no combat challenges so upgrading your ships only two weapon types just makes combat more dull. Same for the hand held weapons, all three of them, if you include the mining laser of course. Now I have the fastest mining tools I dont need to mine ever again.Which leaves what? I suppose I could just fly around and look at weird shaped aliens, but I've seen enough now that all variation is just repeated. I could complete the plot I suppose, but it's just too boring to bother with. I can at least tell myself I got some of my money's worth just by sticking with it for 60 hours I suppose."

I really tried to like this game and hoped that after multiple systems I would eventually find a creature remotely similar to any of the preview videos I've seen prior to release.  This game is simply a bait and switch money grab pushing the limits of what can be legally exempt from false advertisement.  It's rather disappointing that Steam supports this type of fraud.***TLDR: Don't buy this game, unless you want to be cheated out of $60."

I explored a fair bit, built a nice profitable base, upgraded stuff, etc etc.The problem I find is that the universe while vast, is just shallow.  I mean, at a certain point you just realize you are alone with nothing to do.  There is no feeling of intelligence life in the universe for you to interact with beyond a dozen different kind of scenarios so there is no real drive to explore because you know it will be the same exact situation.  Sure, you may find a new kind of world but its just eye candy with no hold on you beyond that.The game does what it tries to do well at this point but it's not a Star Trek - explore and meet new interesting people and places kind of experience and that is what I was hoping for (fair or not).If the game had a  maybe  then I would grade it at that, but for me its a thumbs down because I crave games that offer depth beyond eye candy."

It charmed for a couple hours but every single task becomes a chore and you find little reason to bother moving on and exploring because 80% of the planets are sterile rocks with acid rain. All the creatures start to look the same and you even begin to recognize geological templates. I played for over 20 hours, maxed my ship inventory, and then asked myself  WHY?  a bunch of times. The biggest problem?: They are charging AAA prices for a  Concept  of a game.If you like doing chores with little payoff, play this game."

All resources look the same way on each planet, all the structures found on planets look the same way (Iâve found the same 3 types of aliens all across the explored universe). Even if somehow the planets are different (with different plants and ridiculous looking animals), you can feel that basically they are the same stuff. Also Iâve found that many of the animals start to look the same way after youâve explored a number of planets. Also the space stations look EXACTLY the same in all solar systems. So bottom line, this game had been better off if the developers hand-made 10 awesome planets, instead of randomly generating endlessly the same things. Oh, and yes, there is not much to do in this game really and Iâve discovered over and over again the same technology (technology tree is very limited too)."

It feels unfinished and what little there is to do gets boring after only several hours. And that's coming from someone who doesn't mind grinding in games too much, as long as there is a purpose. NMS makes you feel like you are grinding just for the sake of it, as the ending of the game is a huge insult considering  reaching the centre of the universe  was so hyped and talked about.

        "Comments": "Posted: September 7, 2016              *Note: This game was posted 1 week after it got released I will not be updating my review for any future updates.* No Manâs Sky is a game about exploration and survival in an infinite procedurally generated galaxy That is what this game was supposed to be a game with an amazing galaxy which you could explore with loads of features which were promised.But in reality we got a game that is all about grinding.You start of with a crashed space ship on a planet, you will have to find resources to repair your ship, which is a relatively easy task unless you spawned on a planet with almost no resources which was my case.After you finished that you can finally explore the  infinite procedurally generated galaxy  but after around 10 hours of gameplay you will realise that the  infinite galaxy  with  endless possibilities  doesn't really have  endless possibilities  especially with the planets.When you played the game and paid attention to details you will know there are only a few types of planets:  water planets with a few islands, extreme planets, ice planets, dead rocks with no form of life and plants, hot planets and planets with a lot of flora and fauna .all of these types of planets for example two different ice planets all have very similar flora and fauna which gives you a feeling that you already explored that planet while you didn't.Once you saved up enough for a new space ship, buying your first space ship is very exciting you get excited you are hoping for a faster ship, you want to rename your ship as they promised in the trailer, you hope you will have cool weapons for your ship.But after flying for a couple of minutes you will realise that your ship functions the same as your first ship, there is no different speed in any of the space ships, you don't have ships optimized for combat, trading or exploring which was also promised you can't even rename your ship which was of course also promised.The space combat is not exciting either, you are always out numbered and the space pirates have 100% accuracy.The space combat feels boring and annoying, every time you are traveling with your pulse drive those space pirates show up you will think to yourself:  god why? Of course you can decide to ignore the space pirates by flying into the atmosphere of a planet or a space station, but then again they won't follow you in the atmosphere which was also shown in the trailer.if you happen to find a portal at a planet don't even bother to try activate those things they aren't working, this was also promised in a trailer by the way.Want to play with your friends like Sean Murray said in a interview, don't even try you can't.If you happen to come across a research facility you can shoot your way inside, if you fire a couple of rounds at the door then the sentinels will come after you, but don't worry about that just shoot the door until you are inside then the sentinels will leave you alone, you can just ignore them because they are barely any threat.I think I made my point here the game is repetitive, boring and after a while it just turns into a grinding simulator.It's really a shame to see the game end up like this I've been following development since 2014 and have been hyped about it since I knew about it.But if you compare the trailers to the actual product you will realise that Sean Murray has been lying.I am done defending this game I defended it for a couple of weeks but ever since I saw playstation users are getting updates I am done defending it.The developers took a hugeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on all PC users.Coming to a verdict I am giving this game a 4/10 it was fun for a couple of hours after that it becomes boring and repetitive.I recommend for the sake of your 60 euros to stay away from this game as far as possible.If you like my reviews please consider joining my steam groupI will be posting reviews and giveaways here for every review!"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 7, 2018              So NEXT came out, reviews went up, game was 50% off, I thought, why not, right? Wasn't really sure if this is a game I'd like, I love space, exploring, building and upgrade options. But the harsh condition the game was in when it got released (reading, not my own experience), and the still ''not that much different things to do'' thing popping up here and there, I had my doubts. I'm surprised to say that I've got already 43.5hours into it. Storywise I'm just in my 2nd solarsystem, however I'm currently in another solarsystem for a side mission. Sweet. Ok, time for a review! This game has great points, but also great flaws. I'll start positive; Man, game is freaking massive. Like, I mean, I actually go to space to go to another land sight based on the same planet because flying to it on the planet surface would take multiple minutes or even hours. In space you can travel so much faster, it will take seconds instead of minutes or hours when you would do it the earth ''airplain'' way. Whether you're approaching a planet in space or just fly over the planets surface, game feels massive. And thats just 1 planet, in 1 solar system. Welcome to NMS.Different settings (desert, ice, grass, cold/hot/nuclear environments, name it the game got it, basically) on different planets, but also on the planet itself. Underground spots to explorer, bases, ships, upgrades, buildings, missions, acient buildings, lots of resources to collect, almost all planets have it. Huge tradership in the universe where you can dock in and sell, buy things, get missions, find out about interesting locations on a planet etcetera. Space fights, flaura and fauna to discover, getting your own freighter. Seriously, it's hard to get bored if you're into this type of games. I honestly basically have done little to nothing in those 43.5 hours, besides exploring, grinding resources, explore some more, find buildings with missions or locations, do those, find some more new things, lost time and decided it's time to go back to my solar system #2 for the story. Got a new ship with more slots and slightly better stats, new multitool with more room for upgrades and better stats, got my freighter and collected tons of stuff which gave me a profit of something like 15mil, not bad, not bad. Not that it's that much, saw a not thÃ¡t special spaceship (I think) which was worth 33mil, like, damn give me more acient hotspots please! So the game is addictive as heck. It's offering some relaxation when you explorer, gives you tons and tons to explorer, lots of missions, collecting, selling, buying etc. Still, this game doesn't come close to score even a 8 out of 10, quality wise. So now the flaws;* Lack of backpack space early game - When you're new, like me, you don't know what to keep, what you exactly need, what to sell etc. I've ended up numerous of times throwing out stuff I needed 5 minutes later again, throwing something else away what I think I don't really need in a short period of time. Over and over again. * Lack of backpack spaces working together - You can upgrade your exosuit, get more space for normal slots (up to 250), bigger slots (up to 500), and technical slot. But the normal and bigger slots don't work together. If you have 400 of an element in your big slot and are farming more, you'll get the farmed items in your normal slot, instead of stacking up with the one in the big slot. Further more, you can stack poorly in this game. It only works when it doesn't overrides the maximum. So if you have 400, and want to add 100 but have a stack of 150, it wont work. The stack of 400 wont go to 500, leaving you with 50, but simply refuses anything. * Grinding - I don't mind grinding honestly. But you need basically every basic ingredient in multiple conditions, either to repair stuff or make stuff. With small backpacks that was even more a pain in the a. You can't use an ''upgraded'' basic resource if it requires the former state of the resource, so you grind same stuff a lot of times.* Sentinels - Pain in the a sometimes. They are everywhere, popping up if you're without one for too long seems like. They are a bit annoying. Easy to take out but harder to get rit off. A little tip; if you're close to a settlement building (still in use or not), and you go inside, you can't use guns, neither can sentinels. Further more, they don't see you dispite floating next to you in the same room. Friendly little fella.* Misplaced resource points - Going for elements like coper to a spot only to see the marker dissapear and no coper to find in the ground around where the marker was. Same for other things like ancient buildings and those stones where you can pick up a word to learn. Some other thoughts; * I've been send to the same buildings and acient ruins a numerous of times, which I already looted. So game doesn't reconize what you've already explored.* I'm missing a little bit the feeling of being into the unknown exploring something where no one has been for a long time, when there are a constant AI spaceships flying in the air, sentinels around every corner etc. * Universe is massive, but there aren't that much different races nor languagues to learn. Also all have arms and legs. Maybe because this requires less resources and is easier to code in, but so many opportunities have been missed with this. * Wild creatures are pretty stupid. Not sure if they even have AI. * Spacecombats are pretty much forced upon players. So it's important to have stuff onboard so you can repair shield. * Game has tons and tons of buildings and area poles where you can manually save and name the spot, but you can't simply fly close over it to claim it. You need to land, press a button for a couple of seconds, before taking off again. Since there are tons of it, if you don't really have selfcontrol like I seem to have in this game, it takes way too much time. Planets are massive, universe is massive, they could have made it easier so we can chose our own pace whether to land or not (not that you're forced to claim, of course). Last planet I've claimed over 80. I know, I did it myself. * I've only been in 3 solar systems, 8 planets, but I've already seen wild creatures that look a lot like eachother, or are just a mini/xxxl version of said creature. Buildings are always the same. Large container ships that have crashed are always slammed into the ground the same way. Acient buildings have little variation. Plants and trees, even layout of caves, all basically the same. If that's the whole universe basically, the auto gen is less impressive than first expected.  The game has numerous of small and weird bugs, like floating buildings, spawning in lootboxes into resources (box inside a large tree for example), some missions seems like they don't work that well (like destroy deposit, no marker, destroying multiple ones doesn't do the trick either), my ship was yesterday on fire while having no damage (restart of game was enough) to name some. Also this game could be optimised better, I don't think it's using my hardware efficiently, aka I'm not getting the FPS a game like this should offer.  And this is an opinion, but graphics overal aren't that impressive. Next to the fact that I personally would love to have seen it to be a more realistic graphic art (but that's personal and this works fine too), the quality of the textures just aren't that impressing. Conclusion: There's tons of stuff to do, but it's not that deep. You rather quickly will be doing the same thing over and over again. But there is progression, upgrades, battles etc. If you can accept that the game is actually kinda shallow, but does have tons and tons of things to do in, and don't mind having dejavus, you will def get your moneys worth out of it. It's basically ETS2 in space, with more different things to do and battles, but poorer vehicle control. So I vote yes. But I hope some of my named flaws will disappear in future updates."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 23, 2017              Let's get a couple things out of the way first. Number one, this is going to be one of the most honest reviews you'll see on this game. I'm not a troll, I'm not a fan boy... I said I would buy this game when its price was lowered to less than $40 and that's exactly what I did for the experience alone.Now, before I can discuss the various aspects of the game I need to address the elephant in the room and get past it first. No Man's Sky is one of the biggest lies that I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this wont affect my review, but it needs to be said. Sean Murray is one of the most deceptive, and despicable developers I have ever seen. He blatantly lied on national television, online, etc about features in this game that don't exist (even now many months after release). It's why the dev team is/was being investigated in the UK for false advertising. Don't take my word for it, search  No Man's Lie  or  One Man's Lie  and you'll find all the evidence you need.That said, below is my review of the game. If you want a shortened version, just skip to the final verdict at the bottom.OverviewThe game throws you onto a planet and giving you a waypoint to your crashed ship with very little else to go on. You have a mining tool, probably a failing suit to the environment (acid rain, cold, heat, etc), and need to struggle to survive while repairing your ship. Once repaired, the galaxy is your limit. There is absolutely no hand holding here, it will be a struggle (on survival mode).GraphicsThis game is visually  beautiful ... but also extremely ugly at the same time. Looking at planets and walking around them looks amazing. The effects looking around and flying are fantastic. But the ground textures are EXTREMELY blurry, planets look one way in space and as you get closer change drastically. AA effects are choppy, and animals look almost made out of clay. There are some significant graphics issues with this game that takes away from the experience (even when maxed out).StorylineThis game features an almost non-existent storyline. You get a main questline to obtain recipes... but it's not very up front and doesn't really do anything to tell a story. You don't understand these new races, and don't feel like you're apart of their struggle. You never find out why you're there, or what you were up to. You don't get a grasp of the galaxy and how it's laid out and just move from one system to another to eventually get to the center (which, the outcome is absolute trash and swift kick in your pants).Side QuestingThere are a LOT of side things you can do in this game, not really quests so much as  give one of -these- to an alien  who in turn gives you reputation or recipes. Or learning a language word from one of three races. Reputation does absolutely NOTHING for your character or the story. You can't pick sides in a conflict, and you can't change your destiny based on your interactions. The interactions have NO effect what so ever on the galaxy. Once you've collected all of the recipes and brought a cube, or isotope to an alien, it just repeats. Completely repetitve and boring.CombatGeneral combat is fluid and fun. The worst aspect about combat is currently what should be the most important... space combat. Design flaws exist that really have me scratching my head (like the fact that in the middle of a dogfight I need to open my inventory and manually repair my ship while still flying and fighting). No hotkeys, no hot bar, nothing. Incredibly frustrating. Ground combat involves fighting drones (sentinels) or aggressive animals. Pretty bland, but smooth enough. You can pretty much avoid all sentinels by sprinting away from them. They give up looking for you even when standing in an open field in front of them.Skills, and UpgradesNo skills to be had unless it's an upgrade to your multi-tool or ship. Very little in the way of character development and if you find a new tool or ship, that's your instant gratification. Upgrades are crafted, which can be frustrating for people who just want to explore and not grind (farm). Getting ships is also a chore, or expensive depending on how you obtain them.Game PerformanceI run a PC with the following specs:AMD FX-8370 (8 core CPU) @ 4.01ghzG.Skill RAM 16GB @ 1600mhzAsus GTX 1080 8GBWindows 10I can run the game at 30-60fps on 1920 x 1080 with the graphics settings maxed out. Generally I get about 30fps on the ground and 60fps from the air. Which when you look at the blurry textures, the HORRENDOUS pop in (which I've crashed more than once into a cliff face because of how slow the terrain pops in), short viewing distance, etc... I should be doing a lot better here. I absolutely blow this game away with my specs and yet, it struggles. Definitely in need of a significant optimization pass, even though this game launched as a FULL retail release. Not an alpha.Final VerdictThis game is fun for ONLY two people. Casuals who want to explore and just fly around. Second are hardcore fans. These are guys that stuck with the game from the beginning and don't mind the grind (they'll also defend it with their last breath and probably even vote this review down). But if you're a survivalist, like space games, etc... there are other options out there for you. This game is NOT for you. With the state of the game, poor performance, and other annoying development decisions... I have to downvote this game. Even after the Pathfinder and Base Building updates. 40+ hours into the game and I'm unimpressed. This game should have done two things... been classed as an Early Access game from the start and been priced at $30. This would have saved them from the terrible reviews and they could have explained away the blatant lies with that. But Sean Murray never ONCE explained himself afterwards. He never sat down with the angry consumers and explained why he said there was no multiplayer, large scale fleet battles, and more. If I were him I would have done an ask me anything live (like on Twitch), and explained everything. If it was Sony to be blamed, he needed to blame them. Something to make people understand WHY. With its pro's and con's and there's too many to fit into my review here (character limits)... I give this game a solid 6/10. It's ALMOST there in terms of being something I could recommend. I followed this game from the first announcement... and it failed on so many levels. I watched the launch, and followed the updates before I recently purchased this. If I hadn't paid less than $40, I would be irrate. I can see why it's rated so low."

Why didn't you stop after 5 hours? The answer to that is: Because I BELIEVED it would get better. I had faith. People kept saying things like this: Planets get more interesting closer to the center.  You just haven't given the game enough time yet. It gets better once you get more inventory slots.  Keep playing, I've had an amazing time. Lets say someone came to me and said  Lets dig to the center of the Earth. Theres a pot of gold there and you will be rich. Heres a shovel , and I start digging. After 10 hours I say  This sucks. I'm going back up the ladder. The gentleman says  No keep digging. It will get better. It will be worth it. After 23 hours of digging I'm still having a terrible time. Do I give up and say  that was no fun , or do I keep digging?How about if I had paid 40 quid for the shovel?edit: I wrote this review immediately after closing the game and saw  23 hours  - Steam updated a few mins later to add the last few hours I'd spent playing. I haven't played it since writing this review."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 25, 2016              Ah, No Man Sky. How do I review you?Take a delicious, hard earned serving of world building batter. Put it in the oven and allow it to gently rise and gain a golden crust of fantastic, infinitely different textures. Take it out of the oven, you master chef, then place it upon a golden user-built plate of perfection. Then give all that to your release, sorry, 'finishing chef', to give the final touches. Then watch as he slaps a thin veneer of interactivity over it and then goes on a smoke break.No Man Sky? More like No man would buy this shtako because it is basically an indie game in the extensive robes of a main stream title.And, to complete this review, I will answer the blurb on the store page: âWill you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry. Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.â I wonât be anything, No Man Sky, because trading is pointless, fighting is pointless and the rewards, thanks to a truly idiotic inventory system where a pearl takes up the same space as several tons of uranium and upgrades that somehow TAKE UP INVENTORY SPACE EVEN THOUGH THEYâRE, LIKE, A CPU!â Anyway, I normally wouldnât mind dropping 10 pounds for this stuff, but no voice actors, no real interactivity, noâ¦ well nothing. I applaud them for the advertising campaign and excellent delivery. I resent them for trying to make me thing this game has any value beyond a tech demo.In short: I, having played it, will kindly give the reader of this review an invitation to message me and ask for the game that they thought NMS would be. So I can complain more.Regards, Farle Shadow."

At best, within a month of launch (i bought it in launch week), my thoughts were  Oh well... hopefully it will be like Minecraft and in time, become a fleshed out and amazing game . Now - I don't think that is at all likely. Possibly one of the most disappointing games I've bought in my life. If i'm looking for a silver lining - No Mans Sky has reminded me why it's pretty much always a good idea to wait at least a couple of weeks before buying a game, especially if there isn't a multiplayer component as there's no real reason to be an early adopter with singleplayer games. (To be clear - i never expected NMS to have any multiplayer, that is not amongst my many complaints about the game)Save your money. I don't think this would be worth it even in a $5 sale."

I can honestly say that I am totally the kind of player who loves to explore the more mundane of games, you know the collecting, farming, or oh man if there is mining. Something about mining really gets my engine going in the worst of ways.When the initial reports were coming about this game not quite being what everyone thought it would be, it didn't really stop me as it still sounded like it should be right up my alley. Yet when I played it, there was just nothing interesting there to keep me going. Sure I was collecting and arguably mining, but to no end whatsoever. I couldn't really use it for much, I couldn't collect just egregious amounts of it to flaunt my opulance. I just had no reason to do anything really, and so I returned it.I hope this game becomes a game one day, and I look forward to that day. For now though I can't recommend this game to anyone."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 21, 2016              Let me get this out of the way right now.  This is not a 60$ game  (in my case it was 66$). While some planets are mildly interesting, most are just copy/pasted. You'll eventually loose track of what system you're in because all the planets look the same and there's no reason to explore them other than to find resources. The creatures are uninteresting most of the time, although sometimes you find something really messed up or wierd, but that interest only last maybe a couple minutes. The gameplay gets boring pretty fast and the only reason I kept going was because I wanted to work for the ending. I even got fed up with that though! I made it maybe 10% of the way to the center before saying  screw this  and I just looked up the ending. I won't spoil it completely but it sucks, totally not worth the effort. Rant Time.Biggest issue I have is the ship controls. OH MY GOD THE SHIP CONTROLS!! THEY ARE F***ING GARBAGE!! In space, you're ship handles like a hot s***ty dog turd, randomly flinging itself in directions that you don't want to go. During combat, you have to slow right down just to point your ship in the general direction of the enemy. Not only do the pirates fight you, but so does your ship. Flying in the atmosphere is worse. There's no hover mode so good luck trying to get a close look at that mineral that didn't pop-in until it was almost under your ship! And not being able to fly closer to the ground than 50m or whatever is infuriating. I WANT FULL CONTROL OVER MY SHIP DAMNIT! LET ME MAKE MISTAKES AND CRASH IT! This also makes for a really annoying glitch. If you land too close to a steep hill and then take off again, sometimes you get flung into space. No that's cool, I didn't want to keep exploring that planet anyways. I hate the colours. It makes for a nice screenshot but it get's obnoxious after a while. I would be happy to just see planets floating in the blackness of space, but that's just a personal preference. A lot of people compare this game to minecraft (not sure why, the two are almost nothing alike) but I always compare this to Space Engine. Developed by a single guy, for less time, and is FREE TO DOWNLOAD, Space Engine has WAYYYY more varied planets. Planets with rings, planets that are tidally locked, planets with evaporating atmospheres, auroras, asteroids, gas giants, the works. AND WITH PHYSICS! So why the hell can't NMS do this?? Granted you can't really land and walk around on the planets, theres no real gameplay to speak of, but who cares? It's free! I've spent hours just looking for cool planets.This game is trash. Not only because there's a complete lack of things to do (other than gather resources, build jump cells, warp, repeat until dissapointing pay-off) but because the community was lied to. I didn't even buy into the hype and I never followed this game, but when a developer promises something, doesn't deliver on it and then charges full price for his game, he can seriously just f*** right off. Totally ruining the indie community's reputation, which is already not doing very well. I could go on but i'll just end it here. BOTTOM LINE: THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH EVEN 30$! Pick it up for MAYBE 15$, if that. I probably won't play this game again until DECENT base building AND ship building is added. AND TACK ON MULTIPLAYER SO I CAN PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS WHILE YOU'RE AT IT! I really don't care what Sean Murray's  vision  for this game is, I play games to have fun. This game isn't fun."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 27, 2018              Okay.  I've waited a long time to do this review, but with Next FINALLY out, it's time to do this.  As a preface:  I have *way* more hours in this game than Steam shows.  And I'll say one other thing:  If you're still angry about the  lies  or any of that crap... just stop reading here, because this review isnt for you.  This review is about the game itself in it's CURRENT state.  Okay?  Then let's continue.The first thing I need to point out about this game is what genre it is.  Yes, that seems silly, but it amazes me as to just how many people go in expecting Elite Dangerous or Star Wars or something, and then get all confused when that's not what they get.  No Man's Sky is a survival game.  The same genre as games like Dont Starve, or even Minecraft.  What I mean by this is that it has the same sort of basic gameplay loop:  You'll be gathering resources so that you can survive, so that you can gather more stuff, so that you can build cool gizmos, so that you can survive BETTER and do and build more stuff, so that you can... you get the idea.  This is a popular genre, but alot of people go into a game like this not understanding what it's going to be like.  Yes, it's going to be very repetitive and you WILL have to grind resources at times, and it's a massive time-sink.  It's the nature of the beast.  So understand that before buying.I've played loads of survival games, and I know exactly what I like and dont like in them, and I'm happy to say that NMS does a ton of stuff I like.  Crafting and digging and building, that's all here, and its been vastly expanded and transformed since previous versions.  When the game first came out, there was no digging/building and the crafting was simple and a little pointless.  Now though, it's in line with the rest of the genre.  There's about a bazillion things to craft/build, and loads of special gizmos you can make like refineries and research stations and whatever.   There is ALOT of content here.  Fortunately the game does a great job of easing you into it, so you can learn at a pace that isnt completely overwhelming.The game isnt really about overwhelming you though.  Wheras something like Dont Starve tries to murder you every 5 seconds or so, NMS provides a relatively chill experience.  Well... in normal mode at least.  If you'd like to get murdered alot, just pick survival mode instead.  Just dont say I didnt warn you.  But yeah, normal mode is definitely  chill .  Not that you cant get your face bitten off by crabs, but still.  This works out well when considered alongside the game's big emphasis:  Exploration.  You'll be exploring one gorgeous planet after another, finding all sorts of bizarre alien plants and animals, and just seeing what amazing landscapes you can find, all in the course of the normal gameplay loop.  The game is GORGEOUS, and the improved terrain generation just adds to that even more now.  It makes exploring a joy, which is good because you'll be doing a heck of alot of it.  Each planet has different traits and available minerals and such, and each has a variety of special locations to find.  Trading stations, ancient ruins, crashed freighters, you name it.  Speaking of freighters, that's another big thing.  You can buy and command your own capital ship, complete with a fleet of frigates that can be sent out to do missions of their own.  You can build inside the freighter too, and even use it to store multiple ships.   This is all incredibly satisfying to do... there's just something awesome about having your own gigantic freighter to pilot.  And it certainly isnt the only vehicle.  You also have a bazillion different ships, and ground vehicles as well.  They all control nicely and are outright fun to use.  You have many ways to get around in style, and it really adds to the whole package.When you're not joyriding around the galaxy, you can hit up a space station and take some missions, chat up some aliens (space stations are much improved in this build), or perhaps try to take on the main story missions and learn what you can about the game's lore.  Of course, this is a survival game, so there's also alot of emphasis on coming up with your own goals, which is something this genre is very good at.  There is structure here if you want it, but a game like this really is best for players that like to decide what they want to do rather than waiting for the game to decide for them.  Again though, keep in mind that this is a slow-paced game.  Gathering resources or digging up mineral deposits takes time, and you'll be roaming all over the place to do this.  Some players such as myself love doing this sort of thing, but it isnt for everyone.  Not that there isnt action, mind you... there's the ever present and extremely touchy Sentinels, good at making you want to shove your monitor through the nearest wall (and they have new tricks up their evil sleeves now), or pirate attacks, or big fleet battles involving NPC freighters (if you're gonna help though, be sure NOT to shoot the freighters on accident).  Fortunately, there's a bazillion different technologies and upgrades you can go after to help you get things done, whether it's combat or gathering or exploring.  Get a better jetpack, improve your scanner, get better shields for your ship, get more inventory slots... there are tons of things that you're gonna want.  But it's going to take some effort and time to get them. Honestly, I cant think of too many negatives to list here.  Well, there is one big one:  This is one of those games that has a nasty case of consolitis.  The interface and such is clearly designed for a controller.  So if you like to play with keyboard/mouse, that might be mildly annoying.  While I use a controller myself, it still always bugs me when a game does this (and so many games do have this issue), and it's something you need to be aware of.  The game can also frustrate at times, particularly in survival mode.  When things go wrong, they tend to go really wrong really fast, and then you're left picking up the pieces, as your stuff can and will get broken if you die.  Again though, that's not exactly uncommon in this genre and this game is a bit more forgiving than most (usually).NMS is a game that, despite it's awful launch, managed to become something that outdoes even my original hopes for it, now containing loads of mechanics and content that were never originally going to be involved.  Each improvement has been massive, and I can say without a doubt that the result of it all is fantastic.  It's a huge game with boatloads of content and things to do and one that can really gobble up the hours, and if you're into this sort of game, you're gonna possibly love it even as much as I do... this has seriously become one of my favorites, even despite just how many games of this type I've played now.  Just, again, be aware of what you're getting here.  This aint Star Wars.  And to me, that's a good thing.  It does resemble one really specific game I can think of though... remember Starflight, from so very many years ago?  Yeah.  Makes me think of that, every time.  Now THAT is high praise from me.Oh, and yeah, there's multiplayer.  But I dont care about that, so if you want to know more about it, look it up elsewhere.  You're welcome."

For the first 24 hours in the game, I can say I really did love it, anyone who asked me about the game Iâd recommend they buy it. Around the 25 hour mark I started to notice just how repetitive the game is, not in what you do, as I always knew that was the case. However the planets were all the same. Every planet class has certain materials youâll find on it, and those materials won't be found on another planet of a different class, even if it has the same characteristics of that other planet.. Ex: Planet X is cold, it has Element X in abundance, however Planet Y is inhabited by hostile sentinels, it has Element Y in abundance, Planet Z is cold, and inhabited by hostile sentinels, it has neither Element X nor Element Y, instead it has Element Z, which is found on all planets. Thatâs not me just being unlucky, In my 30 hours Iâve gone to 19 star systems and over 50 planets. This along with the massive list of features shown in the trailers which simply aren't in the game has made me realize that me wanting to like this game made me blind to the obvious issues that plague the experience for me.This will be a game Iâll reluctantly go back to after major updates, but thatâs only because I can't get a refund. I believe it still has potential, but no longer will I listen to anything Sean Murray says that hasn't gone through a PR department.Thanks."

In the whole game after 20 hours of gameplay i haven't found planets nearly as beautiful than the planets shown by Murray.Everyone who bought this game because of the features shown by Hello Games in the last few months, has bought an product which was wrong advertised.It's just the same thing every time, the Terrain on the planets are not worth exploring because everything looks the same and in Bases or  Houses  you will always find the same stuff over and over.now about the missing features:If i order a Pizza with extra-cheese and i pay for a Pizza with extra-cheese but i just get a Pizza without extra-cheese i have paid for a different product than i got, and this is also the case for everyone who preordered No Man's Sky, it has been advertised as a different product than it is.and this is pure scamming of people who are ready to pay for the features named by the developer.I think the game is not worth 60â¬/$."

I don't mind games where you have to grind materials, exp etc as long as there's some sort of payoff, currently there appears to be none. An infinite universe of carbon, which is pretty much used exclusively to power the stuff you used to get the carbon... fun.Comparatively, I still play Escape Velocity to this day as that felt like a living universe with stuff to do, goals to achieve and massive great ships to eventually attain. I had hoped to have the same experience with this as I had with that, but alas this appears to be the bare bones (and not all of them at that) of what the game was supposed to be. I'm afraid the flesh and the rest of the bones will come in the form of paid DLC and considering what we've been given for Â£40, I don't have much hope for it."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 24, 2018              So I got this game when it first released (I fell into the hype band wagon), and I felt let down to find a game that felt like it should have been released as an early access game. It was the first game I refunded on Steam. But later during one of the 2017 sales I got the game for around $35 and just left it in my library figuring it would be patched eventually. And that day have came. If you ask me 2 years ago I would summed up No Man's Sky as game that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. But now their more to the game. -Planets feel different from one another:-their are more biomes than we got at release and each biome got more variety of plants, rocks, and geography-Creatures have more variety-Base building-Freighters (mobile bases)-Actual story mission and side missions-Multiplayer -Character design/customization -More ship varietyTheir more but that all I been able to see at first glance. I get it, this game had a horrible launch and didn't meet some of their features they talked about in interviews. But they stuck with this game for 2 years to try to make it into what they wanted it to be at launch. Most games would have just called it a day and dropped it. But to stick around and fix the game and not do something scummy like make these update into DLC. Its something to behold in this day and age. For the price of $30 (on sale at the time of this review), you are getting a good game. Is it perfect, no. But it definitely worth a $30 at this point. If they continue to add free updates to the game, then it may be worth more in the future."

Once you get past the initial awe and amazement when you first spawn in, seeing this beautiful world before you, the first feeling of  awwwww yeah I'm gonna love this,  you start to see the flaws. At first they're minor, like the tiny inventory, or the lack of instruction. But then, when you leave your spawn planet, that's when even more issues are found, for instance the very lacking interior of the space stations, or the empty space where fleets of trader were supposed to be. As you continue in the game, the overall lack of a real game starts to emerge. With the same repetitive grind you have to make as you try to go from system to system....It was at that moment, when one question came to my mind,  WHY DID I SPEND $60 FOR THIS GAME?  Overall the game is boring, and excesivley repetitive, also don't even get me started on that god awful excuse for an ending.I would refund this game but I think it may be some semblance of entertaining in like a year or more. Hello Games, please if you want to even stand a chance at keeping any fans at all don't even think about charging a dime for any future DLC's you may release."

        "Comments": "Posted: December 22, 2016              The game is okay, but needs more content. Simply put the game lacks substance. Other than the scenery, the majority of features feel rushed and are uninspiring. The features are there so that the game can say,  yes, this feature is in the game.  However, my biggest complaint, which is strictly my personal opinion, is that for an exploration game that allows you to  discover  things, there sure are a lot of outpost/space stations/aliens everywhere. Not once did I ever feel like I discovered anything for the first time. The only enjoyable feature of the game are the pretty planets. Even then, the moment is ruined by ships flying overhead or robots scanning you. In its current state, I would not recommend.Edit: I have not, will not, and do not have any desire to play the game with the updates or with mods."

For some it will be worth the money, for me it is too much.While I still have fun playing it, I just can't recommend it for most people in its current state.However, check out mods for this game. They can improve it a ton and even add some of the missing features you saw in trailers, such as:-large space fleets-way way bigger and more dense flora and rocks (forests finally feel like forests if you know what I mean)-bigger speciesThe list goes on. Modding might just save this game."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 14, 2016               A mile wide but an inch deep  was the title of Haedox's review, and a good one sentence summary of No Man's Sky. Since its release on PC, the amount of negative mobilization against the developer has been alarming, and overly harsh. However, behind the slandering and swinging punches there are some basic valid points. Two of which are that is was indeed released too early on PC, and it is overpriced. But for me, neither of these are why I'm not recommending the game at this time. The main issue with the game is in its DNA. Whilst being procedural allows for everything to be different, this randomness is still limited by the depth of its algorithms. Visit 1 planet and you've essentially seen all 18 Quintillion - Colours, animations, flora and fauna may be randomized, but it all starts to look roughly the same. You start to see the parameters set by the algorithms - eg. placement of objects and resources, max terrain elevation. And this problem with depth is not just aesthetic, it affects the biological and geographic complexity and interactivity - extreme temperature shifts should be reflected in the flora and fauna, life should spring up around pockets of liquid on barren planets, a two ton dinosaur shouldnt walk on the hind legs of a bird. Whilst randomness may seem like a great way of creating a whole universe, the reality is our own universe is anything but random - rather a series of interconnected and relative processes. This is what makes it interesting to discover, and what is lacking in the NMS approach. For a game that relies on exploration as a key motivator to play, I just don't feel like I'm discovering anything spectacular or original. The first three hours of the game were fantastic. Good premise - ship has crashed, needs repair. A new alien world to discover - your time on the first planet is really brilliant - taking in excellent sound design, strange plants, spotting your first creature. However once you arrive at your second, third, and fourth, you start to realise that the game's main incentive - to discover new worlds, simply doesn't hold up under the weight of procedural limitations. The interactions with aliens are entertainingly worded, but again, shallow and repetitive, as is resource collection and trade. These galactic duties are perhaps repetitive in reality, true, but where's the sense of danger in walking a few hundred meters to get that mineral, whilst the temperature is dropping 2 degrees a second? Where's the fear when you enter a planet's atmosphere, wondering if your ship will hold together? I can't really 'feel' that sense of exploration.These are my criticisms, and something that I hope can be resolved. Sean Murray had the very best of intentions for our collective experience in NMS, I sincerely believe that. and you can see them throughout his creation - however, I can't help but feel that the game would have been more interesting if it wasn't entirely procedural - A single star system, where getting to your home planet was key - each planet uniquely different, with bordered 'maps' like Destiny, rich with unique plant life and atmosphere. As a discovery and exploration game, that would have been incredible. It makes me long to relive that first thrilling walk along the lonely coast of Dear Esther.So should you buy the game? I will say this, make an assessment based on what I've mentioned in this review, but regardless of your decision, consider that the small team responsible wanted to build the game that WE wanted NMS to be, and perhaps they'll get there. But regardless, respect has to be paid for dreaming and aiming big."

My whole life I wished I could be the charles darwin of an alien planet, so I was sucked right in by the concept of No Man's Sky. I wanted it to be everything they claimed it would be, I wanted to love it! I wanted it to be the only game I'd ever play again. Unfortunately, It was very hard to like No Man's Sky. In fact, I hated it.Never in my life have I regretted so strongly any other purchase, than No Man's Sky. Not only does the game fall short on almost all of its over-hyped promises, but it is incredibly over priced at a retail $60.00. The advertised  scale  of the immense world is only possible because the logorithmic creation of all of the planets and creatures produce cheap copies and knock offs that are boring, repetative, and uninteresting. The immensity of thier under-delivery makes Spore look like an incredible success by comparison. I sunk about 40 hours of gameplay into this, and after about 16 the patterns in the game are so blatantly recognizabgle, that any suspended disbelief comes crashing down on your head, and shatters the immersive quality.The only joy I got out of the game was naming and categorizing the various species of the more interesting worlds (which were incredibly scarce and impossible to mark for return), and learning alien languages via an extremely grindy collection system. These are the most rewarding activities in a sea of pointlessness. This game is a sandbox, so directionlessness is to be expected, but in other sandbox games, there are unique and interesting story threads and hooks to draw you to the good bits, and you are rewarded for exploring them farther. No Man's Sky has no such story, only vague and shallow references to historic events that have no impact on the game play, or the static and stiff  characters  (if you can even call them that, as the only things you interact with in the game are dumb animals and vendor merchants).To be fair, the engine is powerful, and the developers have broken a lot of ground with the way procedural generation can be used in games, and a lot of respect and credit is due there. The game is also beautiful. The bubbly and saturated aesthetic makes exploring very fun, and the style is detailed enough that you'll catch yourself admiring a lot of the flora and fauna. I took a lot of pretty screenshots cresting hills and looking out over crazy alien vistas, I even set my desktop backround as one for a while. It was a nice stress reliver after work to just fly around and name animals and take pictures.Mechanically on the other hand, the game is lacking in some simple and time-tested necessary UI features. It doesn't even have a system of mapping or tracking the worlds you have visited, making it frusturating to find your way back to resource deposits or just cool sites. The game is very inventory dependent, and the tools it gives you for managing those inventories are counterintuitive and limiting, making you constantly feel like you're being punished for collection things (which i must stress is all you can really do in the game.) The gameplay is incredibly repetitive, and grindy, as you blast rocks to get resources to build things... that make you better at blasting rocks to build more things... that also blast rocks. The combat is easy to master and the enemies lack variety and challenge, not to mention they are basically a lore-less cop-out of designing a compelling antagonist. It feels entirely like an after thought.All in all, the amount of time you have to sink into this game is immense, and the rewards are paultry and empty feeling (aside from building a ship, that was dope.) The story is weaker than hotel coffee, and the gameplay is akin to making cornmeal. A rating of 4 out of 10 would be generous, and its only because I respect the studio and what they have done here, not because I think the game experience deserves it."

Go to the subreddit and look at the pretty screencaps people post and you'll get more enjoyment for free. The only bits that had me interested were the Atlas storyline and getting to the center to see what all the hype was about. Both are an utter letdown SPOILERS The Atlas story seems like it was written by a 5 year old... the big reveal of the story is that you are in a computer simulation. Really...? Really, that's the big mystery, you're playing a simulation. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Hello Games. Oh and when you get to the center there's nothing, the game just says âHahaha, wow, you actually wasted your time getting hereâ and pulls you back out to the edge of a new galaxy for you to start over. It's NG+ without the +2/10 don't buy."

For the record I have had none of the technical issues that most players have had, and have around 10 hours on the game at writing this. The problem of the game is simply this. There is nothing epic in this game. No real reason to travel to the center of the universe, except to maybe see a cut scene or something similar hopefully making the game worth it. Once you have had an hour in the game, mined some stuff, catalogged some animals, done some repairs to your ship, and flown into space, that is pretty much it. Gameplay is repetative and more then a little grindy. Everytime you take off your ship burns 25% of its total fuel. You fly usally less then 30 seconds, land near an unexplored point, (which are bland and unmemorable), click on the point, record that you found it, rinse, repeat. Then since the game is so much fun you need to tediously mine low grade minerals to fuel your ship, power your laser, and keep life support running. Which you need to keep doing because you consume a lot of resources. Then when you mine too much you get attacked by the sentinel â¥â¥â¥â¥bots, because, you know, mining is so much fun they need to make the game more annoying.There is a simple crafting system in the game that has done nothing to grab my attention. The ships are exactly alike in every way except the way they look and how much storage they have. If you didn't mind grinding constantly to keep supplied and liked the look of the first ship in game, there is literally no reason to upgrade otherwise. They manuever the same, they accelerate the same, they feel the same, just look a little different. Same with your multitool. All of them are exactly the same, except look, and storage.Lastly there are the alien races in the game. The ones that always stand in the same spots in their drab little settlements on every planet you visit are boring and have no real AI. The best part about them is that you can't understand them at all until you fly around to even more points, to go to ancient ruins and the such, to attempt to learn their language. One single word at a time. That's right kiddies, at 10 hours in, I have compiled somewhere around 50 words and still have no F'ing clue what they are talking about. Usually around the aliens are mathmatical puzzles to unlock items or to highlight yet another place for you to go to, which is fun right? No. These puzzles are usually noticing a pattern in numbers and could be solved easily by the average 2nd grader. Also where are the Alien cities or the like? The only thing that aliens do in this game is make you feel a little more insignificant, because actually you aren't discovering anything. You are just renaming stuff they apparently already found and are sitting on. Aliens on every world. That isn't exploring, its sightseeing.Sadly I guess I am just bitter. I really, really wanted to like this game. I wanted the feeling of epic adventure that we all dream would accompany exploration and space travel. The game just doesn't deliver. I will keep playing the game for a bit just to see if there is anything else waiting for me over the next dune, so to speak, but I am not confident anything will be over that horizon.Lastly, WTF is up with all the pastel colors. They don't have real greens, etc. in space?Epic idea, poorly executed, and not worth a price tag of $60. This is why I never preorder a game.Wait for this to be less then $20, and hopefully it will be upgraded with some revision and DLC by then."

I really wanted to like this game after I bought it (The $150 Explorers Edition).  The game is boring and you are stuck doing the same crap from planet to planet.  It would have been a good game at $10 because it feels like a unfinished beta.  It has so many missing features.  This is not the game that they showed in the trailers."

The mechanics are poorly thought through. You are supposed to be an explorer, and yet you cannot keep a map...... So very, very disappointed in this game."

For the first 15 hours you're going to absolutely love it but you will eventually realize that your experience playing up until then will continue to be what it is, and that is about it.37 hrs played, 60k light years from the center of the galaxy and now i'm stuck in a solar system which crashes my game regardless of what I do when I load the game up. I am heartbroken if that is how I can summarize my experience."

All resources look the same way on each planet, all the structures found on planets look the same way (Iâve found the same 3 types of aliens all across the explored universe). Even if somehow the planets are different (with different plants and ridiculous looking animals), you can feel that basically they are the same stuff. Also Iâve found that many of the animals start to look the same way after youâve explored a number of planets. Also the space stations look EXACTLY the same in all solar systems. So bottom line, this game had been better off if the developers hand-made 10 awesome planets, instead of randomly generating endlessly the same things. Oh, and yes, there is not much to do in this game really and Iâve discovered over and over again the same technology (technology tree is very limited too)."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 4, 2017              The game is not nearly as bad as the vast majority of reviews suggest. I found myself enjoying a great deal of the game. If you have the time and money to invest there is definately some fun to be had.However, I can't recommend this for several main reasons.1) Who makes a game about exploration that has no mapping system what-so-ever? This is simply unforgivable. Find something interesting but can't use it at the moment? Too bad you will never be able to find it again. We need a mapping system that shows discovered POIs as well as user assigned waypoints and map notes, as well as a way to tell whether a POI has been explored already.2) We fly spaceships around the galaxy but apparently no one knows how to make a basic compass. 12th century sea captains had access them, my 21st century cellphone has one. Why is this missing? Everything in the game is visual flight/dead rekoning only.3) The economy system is horribly broken. The best way to make money by far is to sit in a station and buy arriving ships cargo then run to the trade station and sell their stuff for twice the price.4) For a game that is all about flying around planets and landing on them - why in the heck can't I easily look DOWN? Didn't any of these spaceship manufactures ever get a request for a landing camera? Moms have these on their minivans so they don't back into the garage door FFS. Find something interesting fly near it and hit the LAND button and hope for the best. You might land where you want or you might fall into a canyon and be stuck. Oh and you use special resources for every take off so forget easily just taking off and moving your ship a little. I've even gotten my ship stuck on top of little elevations where it was difficult to even get back in the ship. Why don't we just have vertical thrusters like every other spaceship game ever made."

After aout 10 hours of gameplay, I realized that a ton of the promised features had been either changed, or removed entirely. I am looking forward to feature patches (if they make any) and I hope that they fix some of the problems, but I definitely feel let down by the developer and I am especially unhappy with the  price to gameplay  ratio. For what its worth, the exploration is pretty cool and there is a lot of potential there, but overall there just isn't enough to keep a a player interested except for maybe the die-hard fans who will defend this game until their last breath. So overall,Don't buy this game unless its on sale for like $10. You will eventually (if not immediately) regret paying any more for it. Great idea, great visual effects, but every thing else is lacking and isn't worth anyone's time or money."

If you compare the screenshots and videos on Steam as well as from other sources, you will notice a DRASTIC difference when you actually play the game. I have no come across any such  beautiful  planet that is shown from the videos, not even close, and I am able to play the game on high-end settings. That brings me to my next point, the game is poorly optimized and falsely advertised minimum requirements. The game has a minimum requirement of a GTX 480 but even on my GTX 970 I have constant crashes and FPS stuttering out the wa-hoo. The 11 hours of my game time on this game is spent loading up from crashes or trying to close the game since it freezes for me and seeing I can't close it until I force close Steam from my task manager. Also, if you're looking for multiplayer from this game, find it somewhere else as this game boasts multiplayer and seeing other players, but there is ZERO multiplayer interaction."

You would, of course reply,  Awesome! I love ice cream! I'm looking forward to that. So when you ask about the ice cream box, this person gets really excited, and tells you about all the different flavors and all the delicious toppings they come with, and he even shows you pictures and videos, and he assures you that all those great things will come in that one box, and he gives you a reasonable price for it.Of course, you would say,  Sweet! I'm getting all of that for that price? Of course I'm getting it. So the day finally comes when you'll get your box. You pay the man, and he opens the box. Inside, you find a single bowl of your favorite flavor of ice cream. You go ahead and try it, and it's absolutely deliciouS.So you say,  Well, this is some darn delicious ice cream, it's got a decent topping and all. It may be the most delicious ice cream I've had in a long time. But.... what about the rest of the flavors you promised? And the guy says,  I'm glad you like the ice cream! We worked very hard to make this ice cream, and we love that you enjoy eating it! As for the other flavors, those MAY come down the line later. Maybe. Well, goodbye!  And with that he leaves.So after finishing the ice cream, you finally realize what happened.The question is not whether the ice cream is good or not. Cause it's some darn good ice cream. So good in fact, that you'd recommend it to other people, it was so delicious. The question is, where's the rest of the ice cream the guy promised you and that you paid for?Will he ever come back to give you what's missing? Will he charge you more for getting it? Were the other flavors even real? You don't know. You just don't know. So...... would YOU recommend someone to get the box of ice cream you got.... or not?"

The limit to the inventory currently at 48 is much too low for all the stuff you are supposed to collect AND NOT EVEN ABLE TO STACK! (All the Trade Commodities)Yeah, I enjoyed it for the first few hours.. much stuff coming to you in a short time.. but once you reach a certain treshold.. NOTHING HAPPENS anymore. The same stuff just repeats in an interval you set yourself.. either you stick to a planet for alonger timespan or you jump systems as fast as possible. Repeat.. repeat.. repeat...Even games like Minesweeper, Solitair or Mahjong over more variety than No Man's Sky... (felt variety)If you can get the game for 20â¬ then grab it. The game is worth the 20â¬ but definetelly NOT MORE! In its current state.[edit]21.November 2018Well.. what can i say.. they managed to make the game actually what they promised two years ago..... sad that they didn't be open with the problem back then.. so the game is finally what it was promised to be... so the review will stay at negative because of that. If they were open with their customers right from the start it would be worth to revoke the negative review and make it a positive one because i am actually enjoying the game right now and have put a lot more hours into it since the Update in the mid of this year.[/edit]"

I think it gives you the illusion that ur travelling in space while all it does when you hit the light speed travel button or enter a black hole is that it regenerates the same place randomly the funny thing about it is that you still keep doing the same thing over and over again the story is weak and not even interesting the aliens are boring even the Atlas mission ain't worth following I deeply regret buying this at all."

You will get kicked in the balls, I keep thinking.  Again, I pre-ordered and just like x-rebirth and minerwars 2081. I GOT KICKED IN THE BALLS.Now, for why this happened to me:The game is definitely a game.  No doubt about it.  It has all the mechanics needed to be a game, but that is about it.  They threw as much as the could to make the shell of the game, then they said  Game is done  and charged us $60.00 US American dollars (Living in North America).After playing for roughly 40 hours.  Here is what I find wrong with the game so far:1. When I take off from my ship, randomly, I will be shot up into space.  No trusters, no 45 degree angle into the horizon.  It seems like I have some kind of antigravity field on my ship because that sucker just takes off vertically and puts me right into the stratosphere.  All complements of a weird random bug.2.  Every trading post, colonial outpost, pod, transmission towers or basically any place I visit in a planet is the same damn rehashed building with the same ingame assets.  You get crafting recipes from manufacturing outposts, you get stranded ship beacons through transmission buildings, you get multi tool recipes through abandoned shelters.  Everything is incredibly cookie cutter.  Procedural generated.. My left foot.  3. The game ran like a dog limping home after being hit by a bike.  After going to the forums and doing this and that - Opening up text files changing words from true to false, telling my video card it can't use shadows, overclocking my computer (but not too much because else it will freeze again) - The game still ran like the turd my dog took after arriving home limping.  I did the experimental thing and upgraded my video card drivers and now it runs a bit better.  Here is the kicker, and it is still something that still happens.  I can count the amount of times I go in and out of my ship and there must be a magic number of times I go in and out until the game starts to stutter as if my computer just ran out of it's last amount of ram.  My only solution is to restart the game.4.  The thought that went into solving puzzles to get rewards is outstanding.  I go to a transmission building and you have to solve the puzzle of what's next - 1212, 2121, 1212, xxxx - Take a WILD guess what number you need.5. The way the game handles the user interface.  WTF! - When I find another ship the first thing it prompts me  Compare ?  Uhh yeah.  Show me the god damn ship.  Why should I even press the compare button.  It should just show you the ship and decide if you want to take it.  Now here is the kicker.  I want to dissasemble the items on the ship I found and transfer them to my ship.  I can't do that without me accepting the second ship as my own.  WHY CAN'T I JUST TAKE THE ITEMS AND PUT THEM IN MY SHIP'S TRUNK?  I also can't access my exosuit inventory while I do this, so I am forced to jugle inventory around just to be able to take everything.6. Please give me a damn compass.  Which way is the magnetic north of some of these planets? At least give me Dora the explorer here.  She might have a better idea of where to go.  Or give me some damn smoke signals so that I know which way I am going.  Let's say I find a good source of gold ore, or I just loaded up my ship's trunk with all this stuff and now I need to sell it.  Well, I can't find the trading outpost because the way point has just dissapeared (WTH).  It is very difficult to find your way around because you can barely find your bearings.  Sure, you can travel faster than the speed of light but these ships interior look like my 1977 Nova without a guidance system (how does that even work?) - Again, if this wasn't enough.  When you visit a place you get this damn cut scene that lasts about 5 seconds as if saying  ohh you have found this! WOW   but after the 200th time doing this you almost don't feel like even going to the saving pole.  Once I leave the bulding and I want to go back to it there is a way point.  The way point has a deep color if it hasn't been discovered and it is grayed out if you have already discovered it, but there is a damn bug that shows you the way point as fully deep color until you get close to it.  Then it becomes grayed out  THE RAGE.....   that is how I feel  RAGE  when I travel for 5:45 minutes just to find a way point has already been found by me because this thing can't tell me if I was there or not before.7.  Talking about all these places you can visit in a planet.  Well, if you spend enough time on a planet looking at all the buildings.  Your hud will start to get filled with markers.  SO MANY MARKERS to the point where you can't read what each says or how long it will take to get there.  I used to work for quality assurance at a big video game company and this would've never flown (you see what I did there.  Spaceship - Flown).8. The ship's controls are completely unintuitive.  Even when you manage to move the ship around with a mouse, your yaw movement with keyboard is useless.  It just helps you straighten out the ship - Hell, if they are already not allowing you to crash the ship (as you can see, the ship moves out of the way when you are about to meet a flying boulder) why not just make the ship self stabilizing and only allowing you to move spin if you put it in manual mode.  9.  Which takes me to one other thing.  I landed my ship close to two big flying boulders.  The ship decided there was no space to land and moved forward underneath the two flying boulders.  Guess what happened when I tried to take off?  My ship kept on hitting the boulders until it blew up.  Over and over and over with no way to go in reverse or move out of the way because of these clunky controls.  I had to restart my game from an earlier save. - Not cool.10.  The unecessary grind.   This one is not a bug but it bugs me.  Because if the game was noble enough to not insult my intelligence it would be fine to grind for that shinny new object.  Make is smart, make it worthy of something.  But when you are releasing a game that will make you upwards of 50 million dollars have the decency to not treat me as a stupid consumer.  I have to grind in a very methodical mathematical manner to obtain upgrades in a linear fashion.  Terrible.  An incredible uninspiring design.All in all, I did have fun thinking what the next corner was going to show me.  What will the next planet bring and I am still working my way to a fully stocked ship before I start to really see everything the game has to offer - I just have a bad feeling it is going to make me grind towards the center somehow.  I give this game a solid 5.7/10 - I had to give it that .7 to express to you that it was almost a 6.  This could've been so much more.  I will update this review as I play more or find more to say."

With NEXT now out I thought I would give it another shot.  All I can say is THE GRIND IS REAL.  Add a few more things, make it look nicer and multiply the orginal grind times 10X and you have NEXT. I want to like this game but the new super slow progress just riuns it.  I started a new game as there are so many new mechanics out there you really have to start a new game to understand them.  I have spent about 10 hours on a new game and progress is slow.  Only a couple of slots added to my exosuit, can't afford any new multitools.  I found my first crashed ship and after three hours of just focusing on it I still don't have it comletely fixed. The amount of resources it takes and the exreamly slow gather rate it takes forever.  At this rate it will take 1000+  hours just to get a fully upgraded ship.  It really is about survival as I spend near around 50% of my time just trying mine to refuel my multitool and exosuit so I can mine.  I will jump into my old save since I don't have 1000 freeking hours and see but I still really cant recommend this game even though I really want to,OLD REVIEW:Insane: Definition; Continuing to repeat the same tasks with no noticable results or outcome. Synonym; No Mans Sky.    If there is anything I can say about NMS is that it simulates the emptiness of space and the monotonous repetiton of survival very well.  A huge ground breaking game with not a whole lot in it. NMS is best played casually at your own pace a little bit at a time.  If you like story, structure and action, NMS is not for you.   If you are looking for a space sim, this is not it.  If you like setting your own goals and just exploring, then NMS will fit you well.  Out of the 60+ hours I have spent in NMS, maybe 10 were fun.Surviving at first is fun.  Fixing your ship up, upgrading your exosuit and multi-tool, finding bigger ships is all fun at first.  The first time you get off your planet and start discovering new planets, new systems.  But after a while every planet starts to look the same, hey that one creature has two more legs than the last one.  There are a few really nice planets. A lot of barren dead ones.  Again, realistic space. I think in 200+ I visited during my trip there were 2 that I enjoyed and a handfull of memorable creatures.  The rest is a blur.  Getting to the center of the galexy quickly becomes a boring chore.  Refuel, Repair, Warp, Repeat.  Do this for 24+ hours and you will get there.  Finding that one resource you need to fix your broken hyperdrive from the last black hole will give you a nice fustration headache.    NMS is stable now in its latest build.  Before the patches this game was an absolute nightmare of instability.  Get this game on sale if you want it.  It may be huge, and eat a lot of your time, but the fun factor is just not there.  I wish there was a neutral recommendation but I have to say for $60, no.PS. I never did find a sentinal walker."

Not going to get into too much detail because honestly it's been covered to hell and back.The game for me, started out fun, even with the empty promises I still found myself enjoying my time in the game. I tried to convince myself that I was still enjoying it 20, 30, 40 hours later. And at times I was, in small doses. The drive I guess was to keep seeing more planets but honestly, its all gone now. I cant do this sh*t anymore. Its the same thing over and over again. Literally, everything. Same buildings, same npc aliens. UI is terrible. That on top of every g*ddamn misleading videos/articles from HG leading up to release. Its just shadyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥business. I'm ashamed of myself for supporting this garbage. $60 for a misleading, halfâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥alpha that was suppose to be complete. And getting to the f*cking center. Dont even get me started. This game aint nothing but a slap in the face from HG. Sh*t really just pisses me off the more I think about it, all the videos and interviews I've been following for years now. Had HG been up front, released the game for $20-30 and in EA (earlly access) everything would be different here, but since they sold their souls to Sony, and sony doesnt allow EA games, that didnt happen. One day maybe we'll see the full version but as of right now, f*ck this game."

I seleted no for recomendations because I feel a negative review more suits how I feel about this game.  I like the idea of exploring an infinate universe.  Although there needs to be something to do in said universe.  No Mans Sky falls so short on so many reguards.  First of all, the game has no real point other than travel to the center of the universe, something easier said than done.  Plus when you finally reach the center it just restarts you   The game has great ideas, and if it was $5 or $10 I would recomend it.  But because of its price and the fact it gets boring after the first 2 hours.  I would recomend Starbound.  A game similar to this except in Starbound the focus isnt just exploration.  Spend your money elsewhere."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 17, 2016              (This review reflects the state of the game as of August 2016)(Updated) This game was highly anticipated and I was really looking forward to it. I like many ideas and concepts in the game and the general look and feel is gorgeous. The game feels very relaxed and enjoyable. It could be a lot of fun. But.As of today, this is why I would suggest to wait for at least the next two or three patches before buying this game (aka: 3 months or so):* the storyline feels a little  thin  and is easy to miss alltogether.* (FIXED!) the game stutters and lags like hell, even with the latest  No Man's Sky optimzed  drivers.* the  radar  is basically a hoax / dummy and does not help you in any way. It is just a waste of GUI-space.* your ships' scanner looks neat but thats it.* your personal scanner is very picky about what it revaels to you. While it tends to miss ressources you are needing, it keeps pointing out others you already depleted (espec. platinum flowers, for example.) The scanner won't tell you about animals / aliens.* buildings you see don't necessarily get flagged.* (probably fixed) Locations you discover as a tag on screen will be lost on reload, espec. operation centers and factories which really sucks, since you need to invest ressources to discover them.* The chance of not getting the antimatter recipe is stellar and if that happens to you, you are grounded for ages (two real days now in my case).* landing on landingpatches or generally anywhere close to where you intend to land is a matter of pure luck.* many important functions and features of the game are not explained anywhere (are recipes for the multitool consumed? why does one sometimes launch from ground to orbit, sometimes not? etc. etc.)* avoid space/air combat vs small ships. they will outmaneuver you no matter what.* Why aren't there personal notes (saved locally, not uploaded) to a discovery? Like  Is hostile  or  Rich on copper  or whatever?Due to the fact that you need antimatter to do interstellar travel, getting the recipe for creating antimatter is a cornerstone in the game. Unfortunately it is very very very easy to miss that step. There is no second chance in case of a blunder . Same will possibly be true with other  story milestones , which feels like the game was not really thought through. Sadly, this is true for many detials throughout the game. One can actually find the missed recipes, but it takes some serious time and effort. In my case it took more than two days of grinding only factories and operation centers to finally get antimatter. The game itself does not exactly help you there.All this cobined: To some degree No Man's Sky is exactly the game that at the same time I always wanted and never wanted to play. No Man's Sky has a lot of potential and many shortcomings and bugs. It sure is a lot of fun and a lot of frustration.As said above: Wait till the first two patches went into the game before buying.The first patch helped with most of the technical issues (stuttering, lag)."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 11, 2017              When the game first launched, I was incredibly dissapointed, I'd felt cheated out of 60 dollars. By the time I'd realized how bad it was, It was already too late for me to refund. A full year has passed since then, and I am utterly astounded by the progress that has been made in the development of this game. The dev team cares about this game, there's no way they'd have continued trying to make improvements to the game if they did not care. Don't expect an action packed thriller, expect a calming experience. Despite the original uproar, where this game was placed in the middle of a massive shiticane, the game still manages to place in me a childlike wonder that I have yet to experience since I was... a child. The awe and wonder of discovery as you first explore the planet you were crashed on continues as you make your way out of the atmosphere, and eventually to the stars. The music only adds to the atmosphere(pun intended), and is still good without the game. So let's go over the pros and cons since the original launch.pros+Overhauled story (latest update) 30 hours+Mission system (latest update)+System Economies, wealth, conflict+MULTIPLAYER!? (limited) (currently VOIP, but the foundations of more complex multiplayer)+Worlds have been improved since launch+scenic crashed freighters+NPC Guilds that you can join and earn standing with.+interstellar trading+improved space combat+improved Atmospheric flight+many new ships+temperature measurement can be in freedom units+freighters+base building+way less stuttering and lag than at launch (could be my updated graphics card)+Atmospheric, calming gameplay(again, pun intended)+The dev team carescons-When you boil it down, it still continues to be a survival game about farming resources.-Priced too high compared to other games you can get.SummaryThe devs are committed and the game is beautiful. Still overpriced, I reccomend picking it up when it is on sale. The game is becoming what we were originally promised. Thank you Sean Murray, I finally  feel like I'm getting close to my money's worth with this game.6/10~Astr0"

The only consistently interesting thing about this game is the initial plethora of new and exotic looking species, and planets. But even that gets stale after the 6th or 7th planet you've visited. It might be worth a play just based on the often stunning visuals some of the more exotic planets give you, but the graphics just don't hold up. They may look tolerable while stationary, or scanning an item but as soon as you get moving the FPS plummets. Save yourself some money and time and just pick this up when it drops $40-50."

It seems Hello Games are commited to fixing their game and are well on their way to delivering these missing features and adding a whole lot more. Atlas Rises was a suprise to me, I wasn't expecting so much to be added and changed. I vaguely followed 1.1 and 1.2 and wondered if one day this game will be something even more special and I reckon it now is.

I've officially given up on it. It irks me that the fake game trailer that they tried to pass off as actual gameplay footage is still the first video on steam for this game.

I wish i could say the same... but another walking simulator with some bad space combat thrown in isn't a game i want to spend anymore time in.Absolutely the LAST time i ever pre-order anything on the basis of E3 videos and developer hype."

Pre-launch, No Man's Sky promised to be the game literally everybody dreams about. Touting quintillions of planets, each randomly generated and different from the last, with random creatures, plants, and geology. No Man's Sky was looking too good to be true, and that was absolutely the case at launch.Nearly every feature advertised in the trailers, interviews, and pre-launch material was missing. Instead, there was a boring husk of a game, with boring planets and same-y fauna.Then there was the first major patch - Foundation. Foundation added basebuilding similar to subnautica, a survival mode, farming, freighters, and a whole host of quality of life improvementsThen there was the second patch - Pathfinder. Pathfinder added vehicles, base sharing, permadeath mode, more starships, new shops, and even more content. The game was still early, but the groundwork was there.The Atlas Rises update added a story mode, new planet types, missions and so much more. It fixed major issues with the UI and QOL improvements. It was shaping up to somethingThen came two smaller, but still substantial updates, Abyss and Visions. Abyss focused on improving undersea wildlife, and made the underwater sections of the game look beautiful. Visions added variation to planets, trophies, carniverous plants, and improved the visual fidelity.Then there was NEXT. NEXT is the update that truly changed NMS for the better. Multiplayer, unlimited base building, community reasearch, third person mode, character customization, and so much more.No Man's Sky was a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing failure at launch. But that's simply not the case any more. Hello Games has proven that it's possible to redeem something thought to be unredeemable. They made the biggest dissapointment of 2016 into a fully fleshed game, and it's only getting better with time.I don't think NMS is worth 60 dollars. Not yet. I paid 30, and I don't regret my purchase.No Man's Sky is, in my opinion, a good game. There is still much to wait for, but I say it is worth the purchase now."

The first 20 minutes are interesting as you are struggling to survive, but after that it is quite repetitive. The aliens NPC's are shallow. The planets, moons, buildings, space stations, aliens, enemies, etc.. all repetitive. There is no defined narrative. I can learn a word here or there to help me decipher a random one sentence statement a random alien makes because he needs a specific kind of rock, or not bother. I preorderd the game. Didn't get wrapped up in the hype or the bitter disappointment of some. I played for 3 days and now haven't played in weeks. I am not inspired to try again either.Overall, pretty disappointing.

Unlimited Opportunities and hours of fun gameplay. Now, it's finally released with high expectations and enormeous preasure, which it couldn't overcome in the end. I jumped onto that hype-train like many others did.Now as it's here it isn't nearly that what was promised over the years. Sean Murray and his team have pushed the game to such a high level. The promised features,  every planet is so unique  and stuff. After a few hours you land on a new planet and seriously have nothing to do. I have to admit that this universe is enormeously big with 18 quintillion planets, but the problem is they are partly so similar. For instance, the caves look the same on every single planet. Then it comes to the creatures... After a while you clearly recognize a scheme Hello Games adapted on the fauna system. Animals have these and these legs, this and this head, this and this height, and thats it. This univere may be endless and stuff, but you can cram its content into a single pot, if you know what I mean.No Man's Sky is my dissapointment of the year, although the year isn't over yet. I know that there are people who have fun and joy after hours of repetition, but for me, a game must deliver something, wich keeps you on playing. No Man's Sky promised something unique, but it didn't.Rating: 55/100"

But your planet can be red, brown, snow, baby puke green, or purple/blue and you'll encounter the same spider-crab things that also come in 3 colors!!Hello Games does a great job of marketing and also maaking technological advancements look terrible.My review/rant:I was super psyched for this game (yes, because of the hype train, but who wasn't pulled in on that?) and it is a massive let down.  If you are interested in playing massive let-downs, you can play Pokemon Go for free, whereas this game is $60.  Also, keep in mind that Sean Murray of Hello Games outright lied about features that weren't included.  Do you really want to support that kind of behaviour? I played for several hours (mostly on my friend's account).  The creatures I encountered had the same color scheme and body parts were repeated across different  species .  They did not interact with each other.  They did not react to any changes in the environment except to run away from me, regardless of their  temperment .  There were some invincible bug looking things that were always hostile and on every planet that I explored, with the only difference being whether they were brown, light brown, or white.  Similarly, plant life and rock formations are repeated across planets.  There are no biomes on planets.  Your planet will be hot, cold, or toxic and this will not change if you go to the otherside of the world.  There was no liquid on any planet I visited.  The geography of each planet didn't vary, you will encounter hills, plains, and cliffs, and the animals and plants will be spattered out at random.  The caves seem to have different plants and rocks, sometimes.  Caves have neat glowy vegetation, rocks, and mushrooms  but you can't interact with them.Inventory space is extremely limited, which doesn't bother me that much except things that I assume would be small, such as the common  Gak Charms  did not stack.  Only materials stacked.Your character is slow as heck.  It's not a big deal, really, unless you have to leave suddenly.  It can take 10+ minutes to get anywhere without a ship.Similarly, the game itself is slow, though not unbearably so.Also, the achievements in the game are ridiculous.  You will lose your UI and be unable to interact with much every time you learn a few new words or take another ten thousand steps.  The achievement will take up the top half of your screen and hang there for too long.  I've heard it's  not supposed to pop up during  combat .  For me, it popped up regardless of what I was doing.Speaking of combat, the only things I could find to  fight  were those Sentinel scanners (flying probes that get upset if you mine too much but are easy to kill and hide from).  I suppose you could fight aliens and animals, too, but I got bored before I thought to try it.You don't customize your ship.  You buy a new one.  I didn't see a way to forcefully take one, but I wasn't trying very hard either.Boredom is the main theme of the game.  The game doesn't look anything like its trailers and screenshots because more time and effort was spent on the false advertising that fueled the hype train than on the game itself.But hey, the good news is that there are over 18 quintillion undecorated, sparsely populated planets for you to choose from!!!  WOWOW TECHNOLOGICAL LEAPS AND BOUNDS WAY TO GO.  I mean, I do understand that this is amazing to have SO much in a game, my mind was blown when I heard about this.  But seriously Hello Games, haven't you heard the saying  Quality over quantity ?  It would have been better to have SOME planets or even just one massive planet that doesn't reuse the same pieces over and over.Don't waste your time, or your money.  This can't even be called a game.  It's just a barely-fleshed out concept."

It is a shallow husk of a game that delivers on almost nothing that the team promised it would. My biggest complaint about NMS is that Sean Murray told us over and over again how this would be a living, working universe. IT IS NOT! The solar systems are static, meaning the planets don't actually move (orbit, nor rotate). Sean arrogantly scoffed at the notion of sky boxes and fake day/night cycles, saying his game will be different. Well thats exactly how he built the game, sky boxes and fake day/night cycles. All of the explanations about planets orbiting their stars and rotating on their axes to provide day and night were lies to peak your interest. This game uses the same technique to make day/night cycles as every other.. SKY BOXES!! FAKE SUNS!! YAY!! He talked of sophisticated mechanics that determined what type of planet it would be depending on how close or far it was from the star. Where elemets would be present on those planets because of their postion in the solar system. All elements are found on all planets, it doesn't matter how far or close you are to the sun to determine a hot or cold planet. Its just random, not procedural. There isn't even a true star in the system, just a fixed point of light which can never be reached. Sean Murray is a millionaire because of us buying his lies. ALL of the major features that he was hyping for the last year are not in the game.. 2/10, would shove down Sean Murray's throat if I could."

Cosmos ActivityIs lacking...You can't blow up large starships and space station.You can't interact with others starships in cosmos.You can't dock to large starships.You can't fly to sun, because it's a background what means - there no planetary system, what means - planets always stay in same place and they not rotate.There only 3 alien races.No faction battles that shown on  gameplay  videosWhat you can do in Cosmos:You can destroy container on a large starship to get shistuff that you don't need, because when you need it your ship is to week to handle one hit from that starship.You can fight with pirates, but in 90% they always outnumbered you.You can fight with Sentinels(Cosmos Police) ships, after few killed small starships a large battle starship shows up and will throw 20~ small starships at you, after few minutes they just disappear.40% of time you spend in battle goes to inventory menu for: Repair shields.Refill weapons.Move items from your starship to your suit, because if you picked up items and you don't have a space in starship they just deleted aka  nothing to found .Collect resources from asteroids(nothing even close to EVE) in 8/10 just to fill your engine.CraftThere like 40+/- recipes to craft, but mostly you will craft  Warp Cell  for  Hyperdrive .After 1~h you will start to getting alot of messages like:  recipie already learned  and  inventory full Two recipes (atlas pass v2 and v3) are more like unicorns only few people find it.State of the game at release:Game have  Arkham Knight  level of optimization, fps drops, lack of setting, controls of the starship is poor, broken and not respond properly to the mouse movements.At release to improve game expirience, people needed to edit game files and set fps  max  and change sound settings of pc to fix ingame sound  cracking Instead of an apology for bad start, we got support that say:  Hey mate download new drivers it's sure fix all problems Â¯\\_(ã)_/Â¯ In short:This game it's not even a close to finished game - it's a early access game with price of AAA game.P.s.

All its features were overhyped and most of the stuff that was promised is not even there.There is only some boring and over simplified crafting and resource gathering and nothing really apart from the repetitive exploring.An infinitie universe? More like an infinite letdown because after a while every planet looks the same only in another colour.I do not really want to rant on but if I hear one more  life support low  I am going to throw my keyboard at the screen.Worst game in the past decade."

BUT: hello games is working on this game, and even after how they released the game I can appreciate that. To sum it up, just wait before you buy it. This game is just not done yet but it got a lot of potential."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 27, 2018              I recommend playing No Man's Sky, since it offers fun content for hundreds of gaming hours nowadays, especially after the last update  Visions  and the amazing community events. However, I also have to warn you about some disappointments and serious bugs.The good:* you can explore a giant galaxy with your starship and roam interesting planets with vehicles or on foot* you can enjoy lots of quests, some of which are really nice too * you can dig for all types of buried treasures, plunder depots and salvage crashed freighters* you can scan plants and interesting animals with distinctive behaviour patterns in order to earn big money once you have upgraded your scanner* you can craft extremely valuable trade items like Fusion Ignitors and Stasis Devices once you have gathered all the required recipes* you can read hundreds of scattered bits of lore about the races and about the adventures of other travellers* you can build and customize your own base where you can grow all kinds of useful plants* you can collect several starships on your own freighter and buy frigates that you can send on missions of their own* you can have fun with fighting sentinels on planets and fighting pirates in space* some planets are wonderfully bizarre and fun to explore* I especially love the hazardous flora, and the new underwater content is sweet tooThe meh: * inventory enlargement is still extremely necessary and awfully time-consuming -_- I wish we could  build  additional inventory slots in bags, multitools, spaceships and freighters instead of relying on finding better ones mainly by sheer luck :( Not being able to transfer or move already installed upgrades even adds to this annoyance* since NMS is a sandbox game, some grind is unavoidable of course, but the many time sinks can get tedious, like constantly having to recharge lots of your tech and no upgrades to help reducing this* the diversity of  aliens  (why only human bodies?),  alien  building designs, cave relics, rock shapes, stalagmites, stalactites, trees and plants and colors of exotic planets is still rather lacking, also of ores that meteorites and simple rocks can be made of* the main quest chain is sadly linear, and the Atlas story is very disappointing - the ending even reveals that your journey is utterly pointless* there are no actual 3 different ways through the game, and although NMS has factions and races, there are no meaningful alliances or decisions to make* the background stories about the alien races are just  outgame lore  with no impact on the gameplay at all* learning Alien languages is an extremely boring and super slow process* the discovery list in the options lacks details like world types and galaxy regions* sometimes treasures are buried even below the lowest indestructible level of a planet that you cannot dig into * NPCs, ruins and plaques will always point you to one and the same POI in the whole system, even if there are lots of these POIs on many different planets and moons* some findings (drop pods, cylindric alien language artifacts, freighter machinery etc.) become completely useless after you've completed their  collections * you can't pin several waypoints permanently and you can't delete unwanted waypoints* the jetpack still depletes too quickly even when fully S-upgraded, and you can't make the last necessary step up a vertical incline with a depleted jetpack* NPCs and even  galactic  (in reality only local) trade terminals have nearly nothing to sell* you can't properly select your own dialogue options, and NPCs will also just only ever give super random  directions * I once thought that  uploading  my discoveries meant that they would be added to a Wiki-like webpage together with all other players', so that we could somehow  collect  our data together... Sadly, something like this was never intended by Hello Games The bad: * the Starship teleporter is now completely useless and a total waste of money since it was nerfed to a super-short range of only 150 u (feet)* unlocking translations for the Alien's and Atlas' words takes forever, but even after you're done, many words still stay untranslated :( * finding the last species is still a major pain. I wished we could build and place traps to make them spawn!* the flashlight is horrible, it switches itself off all the time and directing it is a major pain in 3rd person view * the keysettings of modes like building and photography can't be customized, but instead constantly collide with keys you've customized for the usual gameplayHowever, the worst thing is that discoveries still vanish from the dedicated options list and many of these discoveries are unknown again when re-visiting the affected worlds. Others can reappear, but only for a short timespan :( This problem exists since release, is definitely not connection-related, but has never been acknowledged by Hello Games as being an issue :("

I've seen people saying things like  You'll get bored in a few hours  , All you're doing is resource gathering ,  This game is repetitive . However, me being naive, I ignored it and thought I would have a lot of fun. But after about 7 hours, the game started to feel like a chore to play. I've only found 2 cool planets, and the rest were just a total waste of time. All you do in this game is just gather Plutonium, Carbo, and Thanium just to go see bad reskins of planets and terrible wildlife that either run away from you or attack you. Don't forget to mention the cool screenshots and trailers that are shown with awesome space battles, portals, and beutiful terrain with amazing exotic wildlife. Please don't fall victim to this fraud of a game and waste your precious $60 like me."

Too many of the features that Sean Murray said were in the game aren't.    If they were honest about the state of things, I doubt it would get nearly as much bad feedback, but they claimed it did a ton of things that it just doesn't do.Maybe someday it will, but right now I can't see any way a $60 price tag is justified."

I requested a refund, but failed to meet the criteria.While understandable, the fact remains that I am a bit ashamed to have requested the refund, because the game is great now, and doesn't seem to be slowing down on the improvements, more than 2 years later. Right after the NEXT update the game checked all the boxes and I have not had as much fun playing a game with my daughter before or since. She's six.A good story to follow, which she still recalls, is when we were exploring and interacting with the wild fauna and I noticed I could  pet  or  feed  the animals - who would then run a short distance away and claw the surface. This results in a harvestable resource, and I thought this was amazing. I explained to my daughter that what was happening is that as a reward for interacting with the animals, they dig up valuable nuggets of treasure for us to collect.We spent an afternoon doing this, collecting all the treasure we could handle. But when it came to needing some inventory management, I realized this was no ordinary  treasure . It wasâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥  faecal matter . After blushing a bit and waiting a moment to compose myself, I told my daughter we were collecting animal droppings.She almost got a stroke, she laughed so hard.This game is pretty well personified by this story. It's up to you to decide what the faecal matter represents, but all in all, a hundred hours and a fun, engaging universe where endless oppurtunity for exploring and discovery is presented to you should not be taken for granted.But still, I almost got a refund."

That's this game. This is overpriced at $60. I'd feel very comfortable paying $12-$15 for this and abandoning it forever after the first 4 hours. At $60, I expect a fully realized game at the level of Skyrim, Fallout, or Call of duty. It is impossible to overstate the level of repetition this game has. You'll find identical things on most worlds except one will be a slightly different color or the flower will be in a different place or the animals legs will be a different size.I'm only still playing so I feel like I got my moneys worth.  If It was cheaper, I'd have abandoned it on day one and never looked back. Because I paid $60 for it I played the absoluteâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of it so I didn't feel cheated and by now I'm below $0.85 per hour played and still feel cheated.

With overhauls to graphics, procedural generation algorithms and mechanics, and with the addition of new ones such as base building, fleet management, and a new 30 hour story, no to mention online multiplayer, NMS has slowly became what it sought to be at first, an exploration game with prominent SciFi elements. I can recommend it to anyone seaching for a relaxed experience, those who like building stuff in games like Minecraft, and those who just like to get lost in a seemingly infinte world.

Not really knowing what it was untill close to release where advertising went into overdrive.I was won over by the premise and a few videos i watched which made the game look fantastical.A sort of never ending game of discovery, with this generation tech which would generate a never ending mix of planets.Sadly the game didnt live up to my expectations. For a game bosting a crazy number of unique planets, each one sort of feels familiar. I mainly put this down to the small number of assets i beleived the developers created when putting the game together.Travel one planet see a red mushroom. Travel 4000 light years away.. see the same mushroom but yellow and a bit bigger.The limitations of the game and that, by what should have been expected by a small development team, come through pretty quick.For a game which is all about exploring the never ending wonders of space. Planets all orbit a very similar sun. once down on the planet, neighbouring stars or planets have no effect on it.No gravity system seems in place either, so object whcih are half destroyed will just hang in mid air.The total lack of any goals or target feels a big mistep also. I would have totally been fine if i was expecting to find wonderous things or bump into to some random event but sadly each planet feels the same.Sure they may look different, different landscape, different sky colour. But you will always come accross the only marked targets in the worlds of empty stations and language pods.In which are all pointless to an extent.Learn the language to be able to deal with aliens who will sell you items to upgrade your ship/guns to be able to move onto the next planet with another very similar NPC waiting to sell you the same thing.Its for these reasons i cant see any joy in playing this game any further and why i am recommending others not to purchase it either.Purhaps in the future if a mission structure were introduced, i could be swayed to enjoy this more. In its current state though sadly the game is a bit of a let down and a missed opportunity to create some amazing."

Their representation of the universe is inaccurate, every single planet and moon i've seen is inhabited with life and/or vegetation, there are no gas giants, no ring systems. Also, black holes are literally portals. So astronomy enthusiasts, beware, if you thought this would be a space sim you're wrong, it is vaguely based on the real universe. About the gameplay, you scan stuff, you mine materials, find some outposts, fill out your ship and your gear, run out of inventory space, go to the nearest space station, sell your sh*t, and then you move on the the next planet. That's basically what you do until you reach the center of the galaxy for a NG+. About the combat, the ground and space shooting are mediocre at best. All planetary outposts and space stations look the same. There is a very limited variety of NPCs, there is 3 different intelligent species you can interact with, the same 3 guys with different clothes basically, all NPC interactions are essentially the same. All ships look like toys. And all alien life forms look like they were made by a child using Spore creature creator. The excitement lasts for about the first few planets, then the repetition sinks in, and you're left with a feeling of huge disappointment.I have completed the Atlas Path and completed all achievements, i'm on my way to the center of the galaxy, but i'm not sure if i will continue, because i'm already bored of the game. UPDATE: I have now reached the center of the galaxy after 14 straight hours of warping only stopping on planets to recharge the warp drive. I ended up in the Hilbert Dimension, the second galaxy. Uninstalled the game. DO NOT BUY, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Also, what i really want to talk about is how they straight out lied about it being multiplayer. And the game simply does not look like it did on the trailers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8P2CZg3sJQThe problem is not the fact that you can't see or interact and play together with other people, it's the fact that they said it was possible and it isn't. I'm perfectly fine with the game not having multiplayer, i play single-player games and i enjoy them. What i have a problem with, is they straight out lied about it being multiplayer, that is unacceptable, a game developer cannot do that and get away with it. I am sick of these vague as f*ck tweets from Sean Murray implying something but not stating it clearly. It's just a series of shady moves they make over and over again, careful choice of words leaving multiple interpretations, misleading disinformation. Not even the press knows what to make of it. They actually covered with a sticker the multiplayer icon from the PEGI score on the Limited Edition box. Sauce: http://www.pcgamer.com/no-mans-sky-limited-edition-box-has-online-play-icon-hidden-under-sticker/ After years of clearly stating that it was multiplayer, ONE DAY BEFORE the PS4 launch, they tweet that the game is not ''a multiplayer experience'' then tweet that ''The chances of two players ever crossing paths in a universe this large is pretty much zero'' contradicting the previous tweet. Sean Murray specifically said on interviews you could see and interact with other players, and play together. Then on the first day it has been confirmed by two streamers that tried to meet up, they were in the same system, same planet, same spot, and couldn't see each other, for one of them it was day time, for the other one it was night time. And the kicker? Hello Games are celebrating that ''two players encountered each other'', and then say that they were having server problems, implying that's why the players couldn't meet. How can they be so deceitful?Do not buy this game. This should be in Early Access and it is worth $20 max. I honestly don't understand the mentality of  Give them some time. Eventually be good.  Sorry but if the game's release price is $60, it should be worth $60 at release. This is not a beta or a Early Access, although it looks and plays like one, this is a full release.If you're looking for a good single-player exploration sandbox game, get Subnautica. A indie game with a indie game price. 92% overall positive reviews. Has actual survival mechanics, crafting mechanics, building mechanics. Better graphics and VR support.Update: Jimquisition quoted me! http://www.thejimquisition.com/metabombed-no-mans-sky-is-worthless-in-every-way/"

I have never been so disappointed in my entire life. Even Minecraft holds more allure than this game does for me, and I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING love games about exploring space. From glitches to bland flora/fauna you will certainly find this game lacking for that feeling of truely exploring. Sure the first 30 minutes seem grand, but repetition sets in sooner than I care to admit. I only kept playing the game on hope from the hype, and that will be one of the 4 things I regret on my journey to Hell."

Beyond that point there was nothing worth my time.Decided to watch the ending on youtube.Good thing I did - saved me so many hours of working towards that huge disappointment of an ending.If HelloGames were to add major content (if that`s even possible) and/or open this game to modding in a way that gives the community the power to create content, then I might reconsider this review - but the state of this game right now is *insert curse of your choice here*.FIrst Rating:1/10 Not considering the crazy price of 60 euros, and appreciating HG`s rate of patching bugs.0/10 Considering the price. Seriously, calling this a ****** is an understatement.EDIT:Rating after foundation update:2/10Seems they are putting work in their game, feels a bit less off a ripoff seeing them put upgrades like this - but it hasnt become what it should be, and should have been in the first place. Still not recommended at this point.EDIT2:Pathfinder update.3/10Good update. Lots of new things, bugfixes and the like. If they keep this up, it might become good in half a year+.Still not recommended considering the price.EDIT3:Atlas Rises5/10We're getting there. Two or three more patches like this might do the trick.TL;DRWorst buy ever.Promises were made and broken. Minecraft is a better investment.They keep improving though. Give it some time and wait for a sale."

Has potential to be better in the future but as is the grind for inventory size is literally the only progression in the game. I started this thinking to gear up before heading into the centre, ready for lots of fighting or somesuch. Having watched videos spoilering the ending (I won't do so now, but I'd recommend looking it up before buying this), its a lazy ending that I feel is kinda a middle finger to those who have bought the game. Unfortunately I couldn't get a refund as I didn't realise how much fo a rip off the game was in time for steam refund policy to work.I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT GETTING THIS GAME. At least wait for more content and for the price to drop to the Â£5-10 I'd be more willing to spend on the current experience."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 26, 2018              The NEXT update finally turns the game into something that has massive potential. The multiplayer works decently well and is great fun, it's almost as if the co-op fits the game like a glove, which makes me wonder why Hello Games defended the lonely nature of the game so much: it's incredibly fun to play with a buddy.Of course, the game is still not without issues, these are some to keep in mind:- The UI is the most atrocious thing I've ever used in any game, it badly needs a redesign to get rid of so many of the redundant operations that you need to perform to do even the most trivial things. It needs to be unified somehow, and hotkeys would be nice as well for PC.- Flying and space combat mechanics are still not convincing, though slightly better. I wonder why they don't just look at Freelancer, which has arguably the best mouse + keyboard controls ever done for any space sim/shooter. It doesn't take much either to make the experience similar: simply make the ship rotate towards the pointer instead of having a tether that constantly pulls the ship towards it, and then also make the guns fire in the direction of the pointer instead of along the hull of the ship. The first solution will prevent the hysterisis that occurs when you oversteer all the time and have to steer back to get on course, the second one will make aiming feel much more natural.- The performance is not great, frequent frame drops occur seemingly at random, on my RX 480 4GB at least. Additionally, the game is frame locked to 30 FPS by default, which is silly..- The online experience is not flawless: storms tend to be desynchronized, only occurring for one player. Certain devices bug out when accessed by the player that did not place them (message device, blueprint analyzer). Missions are not shared, each player needs to complete the objectives on their own, when hyperdriving out of a system to another one players tend to desynchronize, which requires a re-join from the guest player before they are in the same instance again. Sentinels just act odd, chasing one player but not the other, even though they evidently work together (if one player hides, he can make them go away for the  other player as well, even though the sentinels have clear sight on that player). In space, things can get terribly wonky, where a ship that lands on a space station still seems to be in  flight  for one of the players, causing all the other ships to literally fly through the station. Also, when a player that gets followed by sentinels/pirates flies away from the station to a planet, a whole swarm of other ships follow those attackers as well, which looks rather hilarious (why would so many ships go through the effort to kill those attackers if it's none of their business?). They also tend to clip through the terrain on the planet for some of the players. I'm sure most of these will get ironed out eventually though.- Graphically, the game can look amazing, but also odd at times. The volumetric clouds are very cool, but also very low-res, they artifact a bit much at this resolution. The rings of planets seem to get rendered weirdly when overlayed by the atmosphere of a planet or other transparent things. Freighter textures on the freighter crash site are incredibly ugly still and obviously overscaled. Overall though, massive improvements compared to before.- Grindy game, slightly too grindy, to the point where most of the game revolves around it. There are simply too many things that need constant baby-sitting, monitoring and recharging, it would be nice to be able to automate this to start with, maybe make it an upgrade? Also, exo suit upgrades require much more effort now to get, which is not a bad thing, but it means that early game you can't really do most of these things anymore...- Story does not feel engaging, too much meaningless text, too little interesting things happening that differ from the standard gameplay, at least at the beginning. I know it gets more interesting later on, but it could use some love here.. At the very least you could replace all the  kzzzzttt s by actual noisy words that are unreadable, doing it all in text just looks a bit lazy. Additionally, there's often a big disconnect between what is written in text and what happens on the screen (most of the time nothing happening on screen).- Please, let us have a toggle to turn off the stupid milestone popups (no, skipping them is not good enough..), they are massively annoying, and the music that plays during them gives me a headache due to how frequently they occur.  I mean, this basically just adds to the game's horrible UX/UI. Simply making it a notifications, like how steam achievements work, would be great already.So what is good?- The gameplay is quite relaxed once you get out of the early struggle of surviving the environment hazards. It's fun to slowly progress through the missions, interact with NPCs on the amazingly redesigned space stations, explore around on the planets to gather resources and find interesting things or interesting environments. There's some sense of danger from predatory animals, sentinels, and space pirates, but it's not too much, just right I feel, for early game at least. And when you're playing with a buddy, you can always make up for each other's resource deficiencies.- Exploration is so much more fun now compared to before, the environments look great. Huge ravines, mountains, interesting rare resources, and actual clustering/placement of resource deposits instead of literally throwing everything everywhere. I had to explore quite a bit to find more of that mineral type I found nearby that contained uranium. Structures feel less interesting though than before, they don't feel like much more than a glorified cargo drop.- Graphically, the game looks stunning. It's amazing to see the huge planet on the horizon of a moon, with rings and all, and then stare into a huge ravine littered with minerals and plants. The volumetric clouds, while not having a very high fidelity, are amazing to fly through, and flying past a planet's atmosphere with the pulse engine feels great. Overall the graphical experience is really enjoyable, with some minor nitpicks and issues here and there.In my opinion the game is still not worth its hefty price tag of 60$ though, but on its current sale price of 30? Definitely worth checking out, especially if you got a buddy or more to play with. Besides, it feels like Hello Games is determined to make this a great title, so there's a big chance for future additions and improvements to occur, which I totally support."

The game dosent give you much info on how to play (that can be fun to learn on your own and move forward) but after you learn how to play and move from planet to planet it loses its fun. You dont really have anything else after that. No real story at all, and there feels like no real progression. The good things I can say is how fun it was from flying in space and landing exploring and finding new things, but after those first few planets the all start to look the same and the creatures all start to look the same, and so do the ships and the aliens. All in all it is the start of a good game. Maybe with future improvments it will become even better, and then I will change my reveiw."

I loved that made it more personal to me. Also, the ships & the weapons this time around are a wow I am loving it and seeing a variety of classes and upgrades thumbs up for that. (I wish we can customize those that would seal the deal for me)I am now able to see more aliens (NPCs), to talk too which is great.I an enjoying the base building already made 2 one small at the beginning of the game and the other is large, it's wonderful that I am able to change and customize the colors of everything from the floor, the wall, the steps and even the machines and much more great job on that.Thank you for adding this stargate system you find on space stations then you can build yourself one in your base or anywhere else to move around the universe I liked that a lot.I am still playing it to get some land vehicles and some freighters soon.I did a little of space combat its okay but let's see when I move more in the game.I did not go into multiplayer yet but I sow some streams that looked awesome, I am enjoying it more as a solo player more fun for me for now.However, there are some bugs but I guess they will fix it, it is not a game breaker yet for me.After playing this game again I have to change my status on this game as RECOMMENDED its well deserved, now its a must buy.Thank you all enjoy your day___________________________________________________________________(Posted: 26 Nov, 2016)Hi everyone I have decided to Nominate (NO Manâs Sky) for a new steam award category that I have crerated for them.The  Pinocchio - I've got no strings   AwardI think they deserve this award they are the best Pinocchio ever on this entire planet of ours.If you agree please nominate them for this steam award they deserve it.

Once you get into No Mans Sky, there is so much individuality, that I had questioned at first if I was playing singleplayer, It was such a different concept to name species, plants, and even your own planets that would appear globally in another players game! Then I started to realize,  What is the purpose?  Do I just spend units and upgrade spaceships? Is the purpose to be relentlessly orbiting around solar systems and naming planets? Once I came across my first Atlas station my hope was fulfilled, and I knew my goal was to reach the centre of the universe. I had stumbled upon some videos on Youtube displaying the centre of the universe...thats when I realized the evident pointlessness of the entire game! On top of that, it will dump all of what you had named after 2 weeks. I guess I was right in the beginning.  Also, I forgot to add, do most of you remember how adamant Hello Games was about disregarding the leaked footage?"

In said conversation, we spoke about the high possibility that No Mans Sky is actually quite boring, and they didn't want people to play or see the game in an uncontrolled way prior to its release because of how it could/would affect the sales.The game advertised was not what I received and played. I stayed for a longer than normal playtime in hope of finding the  fun  and the things that had been advertised. I understand cuts, and design decisions can change, but on many occasions I felt like the developers themselves when publicly speaking prior to release, didn't know what the final game would be, and would frequently change their minds when talking publicly about features, or lack of. It is no surprise that the game is being investigated for claims of false advertising, and the developers havenât spoken much over the past two months.Ultimately moving forward, the absence of transparency throughout makes me concerned about future updates and weary of further products made by âHello Gamesâ. This transparency could have massively changed my opinion of their operations as a company, and would have helped bias my opinion of their product(s), but I wasnât allowed in and given the chance. This is something that other companies that make games at a fraction of a price, have absolutely nailed.  (A team of that size, with that time budget and financial budget cannot be compared to âindieâ games companies when it features that price tag and resource spend).âPotentialâ (used loosely) for paid DLC of features that should have been included in the base is a large concern of mine; and like many others, I now own a game âmemeâ in my Steam library that costs more than some AAA titles that severely lacks substance and any real depth, but is accompanied by a horrifically clunky and slow UI. This game also highlights some issues with Steamâs two-hour refund policy, but letâs save that rant for another day.Is this game worth the money? No. What would I be willing to pay for this game if I didnât own it? Nothing to be completely honest having interacted with it. Even though I own the game, I have zero desire to open it and âexploreâ ever again.A friend gifted me this game, and now I feel bad..."

Like everybody else I was excited about NMS, the exploration, the space battles and faction ect. The game starts off like you would expect survive build up your ship and take off to explore. I thought when I first played this that, this was my own experiance, that was not the case resources were close and it was easy to obtain to build the ship and take off. After that I thought now let my story begin my own way of exploring and telling the story of how I made to the center. Oh boy was I dissapointed. No factions at all, the battles are so week you dont need to update anything on your ship or multi-tool to kill anything it was like all the ships and drones are set to the same health. Everytime you warp to another planet you will run out of resources so going to a planet is a must. The space stations are boring with only two rooms. All the ships are not different they all look the same. Creatures are same with slight differences so are the planets and none of them are the sizes featured in the trailers. There are alot of missing features. No Multiplayer which was the point of my journey for me to find another lifeform from earth. This game was a disapointment but for the life of me I still believe in NMS and the developers. The only thing I can really complain about is the price of the game $60 or in my case R 599. People must remember this is an indie game and indie games take time to become AAA beasts but to charge people that much money for a indie game was bad for hello games. I think if the game was $15 (R200) or less it would still make sales. Hype right now is a curse on the gaming industry and it needs to be lifted. Some Developers and creators need to show us the real game play and not created cut scenes of what the game could be. I think if NMS had to hold off the game for another 2 years it would have been the game we see in the fake trailers above but the pressure of the gaming community has again kill the chance at a good game because of impatients. They are a small team that did all this, Im impressed I just dont think they had to charge the price they did. Rating:Gameplay: 1/10 (too many bugs)Sound:1/10 (cool sci-fi music with robot girl voice to help, but it gets annoying after the first 1hr)Control: 0/10 (my 5 year old nephew can play this with his eyes closed)Graphics: 5/10 (good but not good enough on next gen this game could have run on previous gen)Total rating: 3/10Final say: If you like mine craft this is game for you. If you looking for a space game with actions and exploration and freedom, play star citerzin or elite dangerous"

This, however, is not one of those games, and quite frankly I feel cheated out of $60.I tried to like this game, and I want to like this game. Unfortunately there is nothing to like about it. The next planet is essentially the same as the last planet with different colors. Absolutely every planet seems to have an atmosphere and the vast majority have life, so much for  variety . Most of the animals I have seem are at the very best unremarkable.  I can just hope that in the future the game will improve to the point where I don't regret spending $60 on it, but it's not at that point here. It's at best worth $20 and that's probably a stretch as well."

Rinse, repeat.No Manâs Sky, one of the most anticipated games for the 3rd quarter, couldnât have been a bigger let down. The game basically got a running start at something great, then slowly got its head ahead of its feet and is now tumbling down head over heels into a smoldering pile of crap. I honestly donât even know where to begin with this game.First off, I have invested roughly 12.5 hours at the time of this review, and I cannot speak for any technical issues as I did not encounter any (not to say that there arenât any).The biggest issue with this game is there is absolutely no motivational factor to get you to complete this game or âreach the center of the universeâ. There is nothing to get you going or interested and even to want to begin that journey. Unless of course you enjoy stopping at trillions of planets âprocedurallyâ generated along the way.Every planet is incredibly repetitive. Yes you find a few new species and a hot planet rather than a cold, but unless you desire to find every species on that planet or just walking around smelling the flowers, you do exactly the same thing on everyâ¦planetâ¦.youâ¦.visit. You basically start mining and gather enough resources to launch yourself off the rock, warp, then arrive at the next systemâ¦â¦only to land and mine and gather enough resources to launch yourself off the rock, warp, then arrive at the next systemâ¦â¦only to laâ¦.   Woops, almost thought I was playing the game there.The ships and inventory of such are clunky and impossible to navigate. The only advantage to getting a new ship is its inventory space. Other than the outer shell of the ship, there is absolutely no difference in handling from the first ship you receive, to the ones towards the center of the universe. If you really desire your starting ship, all you have to do is upgrade your inventoryâ¦.. and once youâve got more storage? You have completed 25% of the game! The game is basically a journey of being able to store more crap in your pockets.Do you like exploring and discovering new planets? Finding all the new animals and critters running around and getting to name them yourself? Well you obviously arenât playing No Manâs Sky. The various alien races in the game are conveniently sitting in their huts all over every planet you visit. Not only that, but they must have had time to build a space station in every system. So in reality, you arenât discovering anything, you are basically a tourist on vacation to the outer rim. Then there is the alien races language, I have managed to accumulate at least 250-300 words from the various races but I still have no freaking idea what any of them are saying! In the end, this game was a major let down, however the developers did a damn good job on getting everybody to board the hype train, but I could not recommend this game in its current state, not that it would ever change. This game could have been an amazing space exploration and discovery adventure, but it fails to deliver any of that, and will likely continue to fail. Very poorly executed. If the price falls (which it undoubtedly will soon) I could see someone purchasing this or if it falls within the $20-30 range, but until then, donât waste your money or something deserving of an Alpha status.But remember not to spend all your money if you do get it, the paid DLC is coming soon! To add what they said would be in the initial release!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8P2CZg3sJQ"

Tried EVERY settings from low to high, with crossfire off and on. Could'nt get it above 40fps. I'm sorry but this is pure garbage. Even batman arkham knight ran better on my pc at launch. And the graphics are uncomparable. I could live with it if the price would be below 30E. But they ask for 60?!?! I'm not going to mention the boredome which this game represents. Many people claim its get repetitive after few hours. I got bored within 30 minutes. And its not the hype. This is Early access material at best. With lacking features and optimization. Unfortunately they claim it to be a 100% fully developed game. This was the fastest refund ever. I never even hesitated. Short: Avoid!!! Unless you don't know what to do with your money. But instead of buying this piece of &)($&)(&_ $_Â£)*( &%)(&%Â£ !!!!! buy a sandwich for a homeless person.p.s. my english is cr@p, I know. Don't need to comment about it."

NEW BEGINNINGS.About 30 minutes into it I was settling in and actually started to enjoy myself a little.CRASH to desktop (last 30 minutes lost) I didn't start over again.UPDATE - 4 / 4 / 2017I tried the game again today with a single card instead of SLI and ran it at 1440P resolutioninstead of 4K resolution. I maxed every single setting fully with the exception of havingAnti Aliasing turned off completely because it was cutting my framerate in half and doesn'tseem to make any graphical improvements anyway at 1440P. But overall the game lookedgreat. I was getting 80-150 FPS and it ran very good. As for the gameplay, I'm not ready todive back into that yet. A few more updates and I might. I just wanted to let you know thatthe game is definitely running and looking a **** ton better.Well.... I guess I'm finally giving up. I sincerely felt bad for Hello Games the way it all went down. They just got caught up in the marketing hype train and rolled with it I guess. So I just tried the game again on Jan/18/2017 because I played it for 11 hours on release trying to force myself to love it because I too was on the hype train and one of their biggest defenders.My Computer Speci7-4790K @ 4.432 Gigs of High Speed Crucial Ballistix RamSabertooth Mark S Special Edition MotherboardDual EVGA GTX 1080 Superclocked Graphics Cards @ 2050 MHZ EachEVGA 1300 Watt G2 Power Supply3 Samsung 850 EVO SSD Drives with 2 TB's Of StorageA Sony 4K Monitor and the game not only looks like pure mudd butt with every single setting maxed but I get frame rates in the 20's and 30's at 4K.. If I'm running Star Wars Battlefront which looks like a CGI Movie at 120-150 FPS Maxed in 4K, while this game literally has Nintendo 64 textures in many areas, it's now obvious to me that they'll never make it what I thought it was going to be. A million updates won't make it what I thought it was. I yelled at a lot of people while defending this game. I was just a moron defending my own ignorance. HYPE TRAIN !!!This game is terrible2/10  but only because the concept was amazing"

I'm losing interest. Quickly. I'm like many people who realize that I will never be able to go explore the stars and I was hoping that No Man's Sky would help scratch that itch. Well...it did. For about 3 hours. And then i started to realize the repetitiveness, the blandness. And the glitches. Oh my word the freaking glitches. Honestly I would probably be enjoying this game so much more if there weren't so many glitches in the darn thing. Getting stuck in the ground, stuck in walls, falling below the darn ground and dying in water somehow and losing all the stuff I had just picked up! Grr. Now I wasn't part of the hype train. And I actually waited before buying the game as well. I saw all the negative reviews and I was like  well...maybe.  Man was I wrong. Don't be like me. It's really just not worth it."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 14, 2017              A lot of things have changed for this game and it's been quite a controversial game since last year's launch owing to overpromising but under delivering. At it's current state it's a much better game and approaching what was promised though it still has ways to go in terms of adding depth to make the game extremely compelling.The mission and economy system now injects some more life to the universe and appears like a more basic version of what is currently available in Elite Dangerous in regards to missions and trading and such. It is encouraging and brave for a developer who's received so much flak continue to work hard and add so much a year on. Though I guess at this point it's a matter of reputational survival that they probably decided not to give up. If they don't really try to fix it and win back the hearts of the public at large then no new projects by HG and members of th development team will gain traction in the future. But I digress.However, I still believe that no matter how far they add, I believe that the game's core will remain and that will only appeal to a certain type of gamer and I believe Sean Murray's statement that it's a  niche game and it's a very chill game  will remain true going forward. I feel people need to continue to keep this in mind. It's a game about exploration and 'the journey' as opposed to the destination. You play this to relax, enjoy the sights and not to necessarily grind day to day. You determine your own objectives, your own goals, your own benchmark for success or achievement in any particular play session. That is not for everyone.The main gripes I see with the game has been the lack of variety and I believe this will eventually be iterated upon by HG as they continue to add assets. As evident in 1.3 with the new biomes and asset variety, this can really make planets, flora and fauna more diverse in the future. I would suggest people who had not bought it or refunded at launch to jump in and those who still have the game to try it again and perhaps update your review. The fact they are adding this much and supporting it continuously is more than most AAA publishers or studios these days. I for one will be continuing to support HG and look forward for what else they have to offer."

ANIMALS. a big one. MOST OF them look exactly the same or they have drastic changes. But what does it matter when... they all act the same, they eat the same, they behave the same. and to add to that, ALL the buildings in the game, from the 3-4 different factions.. have like wut? 3-4 different buildings which is just copied and pasted in all over the planets? THE GAME. is about EXPLORATION.... exploring the sameâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥over and over again... is that fun to you?it even lacks in the exploration part cuz all you do is basically just rediscover, and see the sameâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥all over again... And on top of that. sean murray the founder or whatever lied multiple times about the multiplayer aspect of the game, just to get it to the selling point, and then revoking that making it a singleplayer game before the release day..... Litterally this game will die out in less than half a year if they dont make some drastic changes.Cuz as it stands now the only way to make money is by farming on planets, griding for no purpose at all...  BUT OH the game has a PIRATE SYSTEM. you get ABSOLUTELY nothing out of killing ships AND the combat system in the game, lacks majorily. Its not enjoyable at all. Theres not even a bounty system, so you cant deliver a  kill  to get some cash...I could go on and on. but the point is. The game is absolute garbage and boring as it stands now...they should have waited another year before releasing this 100%. such a scam"

And after that it felt like I had to be a resource miner, that I also did not want. I liked the idea of an infinite universe to explore but the graphics were lacking on GTX 1080 and i7-5820k and latest drivers installed. It looked too console'ish and who wants to mine on every redundant planet? I would not be so critical if the price was not at a AAA level. I may buy again if it comes on sale. But was hesitant to invest 2 hours and not be able to refund. Most games take longer than 2 hours to make a final determination of quality. I just did not want to take the chance on a AAA priced title."

Or that I could click this one harder.Sean Murray, Hello Games, Sony, and Steam are all guilty of, and continue to participate in, false advertising, in the form of bait-and-switch.  To this day, the trailer in ads and on this store page is still the one created about two years ago, showing both gameplay and graphical features that are not in the game you're considering buying.  This is both immoral and illegal and I'm surprised Steam is still complicit in it.That aside, if we just look at the game you'll get if you ignore all of our reviews and throw your money away on it, it's still a very bad buy.  There is ultimately no reason to have played the game.  I've played the game to completion, with 100% of the achievements and every storyline fully-finished.  And honestly I don't feel like I've even played a game.  The actual meat of those tasks probably took only about half an hour, with the rest being mindless, repetitive mining and warping.  I'd say I've simply spent a few weeks holding down the left button on my mouse while I grind materials to slog through the slow, unrewarding, opaque storyline, right up to the intelligence-insulting  ending .  I won't spoil it for you (hell, it's already rotten anyway), but it's not worth an hour of gameplay, let alone the hundred or more you'd put in to get to it.But, you say, what about the wonderment of exploration purely for its own sake?  The beauty of these alien worlds?  Yeah, that's there, to some extent, on a few niche planets anyway, and as a result you might mistake this for a good buy for a little while, but after a couple of days you'll realize you've long-since seen every component they construct the worlds from already.  You might not have seen them collected together and colored a certain way, but you've seen them all.  The vastness of the universe doesn't change the dullness of the small palette it's painted from.  Consider pi... interesting number, infinite digits below the decimal point... but every digit is still just 0-9.It's a tech demo.  Honestly, it's not even a very good tech demo.  I'm not saying it's awful, but I've seen destructible, randomized voxel/marching-cubes worlds before, and I've seen them done better.  I've seen randomized weapons and ships before, again done better and with much more variability.  It's like HG put together a lot of tech that really needs to be put together, but did a mediocre and uninspired job putting it together, and then they didn't do very much with the results to make it fun.Seriously, just don't do it.  Maybe if you're someone who can enjoy larping, you'll be able to imagine a game where there is none and have some genuine enjoyment, but 97% of the people reading this are better off buying something else.  Even at its best, this should only be a $20 title.  $60 for NMS is ludicrous when something like GTAV or Fallout 4 was the same price for a thousand times more content, gameplay, and fun."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 18, 2016              Do Not Buy This Game.The developers took the most boring repetitive and tedious parts of flight simulators, resource management, crafting and exploring and combined it into one horrifying whole.  Boring flight simulator part:  The controls are dull and don't allow stunt flying or exciting maneuvers.  I do more high speed maneuvering on a motorcycle in GTA 5.  Everything in NMS is life-size.  Planets are as big as real planets, and it takes just as long to get anywhere.  There is only 1 point and click and thats when you warp from star system to star system.  Everything else, like going to from a planet to a moon, has to be done in boring flight simulator mode.  The space engine has different speeds, but you still end up waiting 10 minutes with your fingers on the acceleration key.  No autopilot, so you can't even read a book or surf the web while you're waiting for it to be over.  This flight simulator mode and running around on planets is what you spend the great majority of your time doing.Boring resource management:  You need resources for everything, but these barren planets don't give you what you need and your ship has the cargo capacity of a little red wagon.  You need to refuel your spacesuit, laser-mining-multitool gun, and life support every few minutes.  It's a tedious chore.  The tiny cargo capacity, big enough for a pepsi and a pack of cigs, doesn't let you stock up on vital resources.Crafting:  Another tedious chore to support the boring resource management.Environments:  Buildings have almost identical interiors.  Aliens are humans with different heads.  The procedurally generated animals were a novelty at first, but that quickly wore off.  Barren planet after barren planet, while I run out of resources to craft the components I need to build the supplies I need just to get the heck out of wherever I am.  Oh, and did I mention the security robots which mysteriously inhabit these planets are on me like white on rice whenever I shoot and/or harvest something?  The environmental hazards are all exactly the same and they are dealt with by refueling your spacesuit every minute or two.  Toxins, radiation, heat, cold, all exactly the same, and there's ALWAYS a storm which makes you refuel your suit every 30 seconds instead of every minute.Exploring is boring.  Your character is the most out of shape astronaut in the history of space travel and can only run a short distance.  So you trudge and trudge, or you hop your spaceship everywhere.  Soon you're not exploring and discovering at all just hopping from one point of identical interest to another, dealing with the security robots and running out of resources.Your Character:  You don't get to make your character, or even NAME your character.  It's all first person and in my spaceship I can't turn my head.  It's hard to see and be aware of what's going on.Anyway.NMS does what it says it does.Everything is procedurally generated, and 80% similar.There are animals and environments.There are zillions of stars and planets that you can go to.You can discover things and name them.There are plenty of barren wastelands to explore while refueling your suit and searching for resources.There are space battles, sort of.Tragically, all of these things are extremely tedious.  Not one of them is more than a novelty for the first few times.I was so excited for this game.  I love exploring, I like space games... I had such high hopes for this game.  I'm utterly disappointed."

This was a gift from my son, so I just jumped in and started playing.  I was excited to be playing a game that was procedurally generated, not having played one of those before.  My impressions after playing 200+ hrs has been multifold.....  repeative npc's, animals, plants, and planets.... you run out of things to do really quickly if you're looking for quest driven stuff... trying to get to the center of the universe seems like something only the most dedicated could accomplish (I never made it there)....... Thoughts since the latest update:  base building, etc. has offered more to do, along with quest driven things.  Love the portal from the space station idea.  That solved so much (trying to get back to base after jumping to other star systems, for example)....  Great update.  I look forward to more in the future, hopefully adding yet more to do in the game.  It still tends to get rather repetitive, but this last update seems to indicate more coming in the future.  The price is STILL too high for this game, however.......... so unless and until it comes down, I would not recommend the game.  If/when it does come down, either via sale or price, I would recommend it.... it'll be fun for awhile."

No giant snakes? No faction wars?  OH and no multiplayer? EVEN THOUGH Sean specificly said it WAS multiplayer multiple times. NOT ONLY THAT. I decided to give the game a chance to find some of that hope, I found nothing. OK so I ask for a refund. I get no refund. I email Hello games, a NICE email and I did not get a refund. #1 Runs like crap on my EVGA 1070 FTW i5 6600k skylake 8GB DDR4 RAM. #2 More than half the content is mission on the full release. #3 No multiplayer / false advertisment. #4 No actual support. #5 They care about the  1%  more than the 99% who actualy are sufering... They are focusing the 1% to distract everyone from the real problem.Final verdict, DO NOT buy this game any time soon period. Do not buy until all the content previously showcased is in it. DO NOT pay $60 for this game. It is barely $20 worth max. You can do more in Elite dangerous and the game is far less money and those guys are really cash grabbers. Most of all. I WANT MY MONEY! NOT A FAKE VERSION OF NMS!"

See if I can get a refund as I will not be playing it anymore.This game has nothing to do with the picture all over the net, it runs so poorly on my PC that it makes the game fill like a drag. about 80% of what was promised  in the game is not there.I am very upset with the way I was lied to by the people that made this game and hope that they learn from this and never do it again.If you are thinking about getting this DON'T, please do not fall for all the hype I did. I'm hoping I can get my money back as the game has made me think twice about paying any game on day of release now."

None of the promised features, things you were shown on the trailers, stuff that were so hyped about, are in the game.  I want a refund and requested one here because I felt cheated out of money on false and decieving advertisement.  DO NOT BUY, HUGE DISAPOINTMENT."

Not in the least.Really disappointed as the advertising hype made this game sound fantastic. It really isn't. Which is sad."

I don't mean to say anyone who ENJOYS the game is a moron at the same time, to each their own. I just can't get over how many obnoxious sods try to advocate for Sean Murray & Hello Games' PR group as if  they told us this is what No Man's Sky would be, you are just dumb . This game was falsely advertised, and cold hard evidence supports that. Sean Murray's mysterious disappearing act other than his jaded Support Update posts should confirm it. Why hasn't he gone back in front of cameras, back on stage, to bask in the glory of all his promises? Yea - because they didn't happen, and he knows it. Hope you made enough money to last the rest of your life Sean, because you made a  one-and-done  appearance in the gaming industry as far as I'm concerned.To any of those people who like defending Sean Murray/No Man's Sky as  Accurately Advertised  - you can stop talking, because as soon as that opinion comes out of anyone's brain, I stop listening/reading/etc. just like Sean Murray seems to be doing with our Feedback. This review is like voting, I know it doesn't really matter in the end, but I do it because it's my duty."

Ship handling is very much non existant on mouse+keyboard. I havent experienced a lot of game crashing, but it has happened a few times, usually when theres giant frame loss. Unable to change from full screen to windowed without restarting the game, on a 2016 release is a joke really. Textures are not amazing close up, animal generation is a bit too random. I got this as a birthday gift and overall I think the game is a enjoyable, chill, experience, when its not lagging, but, at the end of the day, there isn't enough content, or things to do in this game to warrant its price tag. Gameplay becomes grindy and repetitive. Planets all merge together with not a lot to set them apart. Combat with drones and pirates offers very little challenges.This is very much a niche indie game and it should be priced accordingly, in the $20 range(and for this price I would give this game a thumbs up). Definitely recommend experiencing this game on a sale price if you are in to exploration/walking simulator types in which I would give this a very high grade still, but if you are looking for any survival/combat elements, this is just not there."

I gave it a chance, and really tried to get past the surface and get into the game, hence the play time, but it just did not manage to cut it, especially with all the hype that the developers had been creating.In all, I'd say this game is a mile wide but only an inch deep, there's nothing to it once you get below the surface, except for distant missions of reaching the centre of the galaxy. Very underwhelming."

There is so much potential in this but as of writing this review it's not there. What i was expecting from this game and what you actually get: - A Space exploration gameWhile yes the focus was mostly planet side in most of the videos and interviews we saw leading up to the release. In these videos however we see epic space dog fights, fighters flying in wing formations and a rather fun looking experiance. What we got: something that feels tacked on, an after thought. The ship flies like a drunk pregnant hippo in glue. Its sluggish unresponsive, you can't fly close to the ground. The landing mechanics DO NOT WORK, you basically guess if you are close enough to land on the landing pan but often land RIGHT next to damn thing! The ships often do look awesome but they all fly the same, once you have maxed the cargo slot space then there is never a need to change your ship other than visually. - Procedurally generated universeOk so yeah technically we did get this. however simply changing a colour pallet and what (rather limited) assets the game uses often makes things a little boring, Honestly i have seen more interesting landscapes from Minecraft. Also with this come procedurally generated creatures to inhabit your 18 bizzilion worlds. Pity most of them look so stupid it's hard to take it seriously. I have gotten creatures with MASSIVE top portions then supported on 2 toothpick sized legs and then a tiny shrunken head. It's a laugh the first 40 times but after a time you notice the limited assets that the animals are using, and then they begin to look much the same. - A Survival Crafting GameOk i do like this style of game. However with it being survival you would assume there is some sort of SURVIVAL aspect to the game. Nope none to be had, EVERY planet ever has so many resources that you can't run out of ANYTHING. Sure you may have to hunt for some rarer materials to build some of the things but honestly the âsurvivalâ part feels very much like how many games call it an âRPGâ just because you level up and can improve your character. The crafting is also seemingly tacked on like a forgotten mini game. You find blueprints (often the same ones you already had) all over the place, so it really does not feel special or unique when you find these, just more like you should have had them from the start but we needed a way to make you grind.- A Chilled Game ExperienceHoly buthole batman you need to a gosh darn zen master not to rage at the frame rate drops that happen every 4 hours or so (if one happened in first 2 hours i would have done a request for a refund trust me). Or the crashes to desktop? Or your ship that you landed on the surface of a planet now somehow stuck deep inside the core of the planet and you can mine down any more to get to. Best part is i am one of the lucky few that had a âgoodâ release. I now sort of wish i had not so i could have asked for my money back instead of playing more to hope it got better. When all's said and done, i would say pick this up on a sale maybe (like a 60% or more, then the price point will be fine) or wait until some content is added to the game. However if they have the insane idea of EVER charging for the DLC i will change this and bit to simply Originally posted by Me in the future:Never buy this game, we were promised so much and they came so close but they lied and fabricated so much, the original price was a AAA price for a VERY indie game and now they want you to pay for the content that was meant to be in the game in the first place? NO!If you are wanting an open ended space game can i please rocomend Elite Dangerous or if you are looking for a game that can teach you about space but with EXPOLSIONS then Kerbal Space Program [www.gog.com]"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 22, 2016              I cannot recommend this game mainly due to it's lack of content and repetitiveness at the moment.NMS gets so repetitive after the first hour it's insane. Many of the things that were promised to us by the devs aren't even in game. You cannot forge alliances with different races and there is no huge variety in planets. Yes the planet's are different, but it feels they're lazily different... It's almost like on every planet the flora and minerals are the same but the colors change and that's it. Sometimes there's water, sometimes it's a purple wasteland. Heck, you can't even rename your ship like they've promised.It was fun at first to explore and discover different star systems and upgrade your ship. I think I've even learned 200+ words of alien language in-game just to understand some kind of story better and it was fun to interact with the aliens. Even though they were just mindless drones sitting in one place. There are still those little things in the game that would make it worth buying BUT this is not a game for completionists. In this game you will not achieve, you will not compete to be the best and there is no score to tell you how well you've done.I'm not going to spoil anything, but after getting to the center of the universe... after playing countless hours and just warpping from system to system and listening to your LIFE SUPPORT BEING CRITICAL the payout is not what is deserved. Infact, just because of the ending I'm going to try and issue a refund for this game but it will probably not go thru because I've already played the game for so long. Great potential gone to waste.

I ran into a bug or two and I was one of those people that crashed after the HG logo, but those things didn't put me off the game until a few days ago. I log onto my account and everything is gone. Everything. No saves, no discoveries, no progress. The game had reset to the very beginning. I wrote support, but so far nothing there either. Now, I don't know if I should wait for support to see if my save files can be restored or should I start another game? Will the game do this again after many hours of progress? Frustrating beyond words. I still show 34 hours of play and have my steam achievments, but starting from scratch leaves me a bit demotivated. I would not reconmmend buying this game until this and other major faults are repaired and maybe a bit more content is added as well."

It's certainly not worth full retail price.The gameplay loop is incredibly shallow and repetitive, with no clear stakes to make progress meaningful. You mine resources - find blueprints - upgrade equipment - mine resources - find blueprints - upgrade equipment - ad nauseum. You repeatedly find blueprints you've already found. If you swap out equipment, all your upgrades are wiped and you need to re-upgrade the new piece of equipment. Why are you upgrading? Just for more inventory slots. And what are the slots for? More resources so you can afford more upgrades. Some resources are so abundant as to be meaningless, and others are so haphazardly distributed that it's either glut or famine. You can only find resources by stumbling across them, there are no maps, nor intuitive clues you can discern to learn where a particular resource may be. Trade is meaningless. There isn't enough of a single resource to meaningful buy from the galactic trade terminal. NPC interaction is meaningless. Arbitrary multiple choice if correctly guessed rewards you with blueprint, or equipment that you may or may not already have. Ancient alien artifacts teach you the vocabulary of the existing aliens, so you have a greater chance in the above guess.You discover and name unexplored planets, that have buildings, ships flying around, aliens, and trading posts. I'm reminded of Columbus  discovering  the inhabited Americas. To buy a new ship you must either find a crashed on in the game world (30+ hrs in I have found exactly 2), or you must speak to a passerby in his ship. So, you can spend up to an hour waiting for randomly generated ships of various configurations to arrive where you are, and hope you have the cash to afford it. If you wait too long, or turn your back, the ship flies away, possibly never to be seen again. What are you looking for in a new starship... well, actually only inventory slots matter. There is no distinction between tiny zippy-looking fighters, bulky freighters, weird science vessels or explorers. They handle the same, with a turning circle of a Volkswagen Bus from 1968.The log records all fauna and flora you discover, but not resources. So you do not know where a rare resource was unless you name the planet something obvious like  UnobtaniumHere . Flying through space, there is no inertia. It feels like you're flying through peanut butter. Take you finger off the throttle and you stop dead. Flying in atmosphere is restricted. The autopilot  prevents  you from crashing, so you cannot fly  under  anything (like floating islands of rock) or close to the ground. Landing is done by hitting X, but you cannot actually see where you land. You mostly feel it out, and hope. You're allowed a single waypoint at any given time, which can disappear at any time. Maps are mostly useless. There is one on your ships dashboard for the system you're in showing you planets, but it's not very useful. The Galaxy map has limitations on zoom level, unlike Sean's onstage demo. There are no planetary maps. As a result, it is sometimes impossible to find something you've already found in a system, like a trading post. Even if you waypoint it, that waypoint may just disappear. There is no explanation of some really basic operations/icons/features. I had to learn from reddit how to sprint-jump, which counter intuitively involves the mÃªlÃ©e attack button, the sprint toggle and the jetpack thrust. The game also never tells you about equipment adjacency bonuses in the inventory. The red shield icon on the bottom right confused me for the longest time. It's not a shield, it's the shape of your exosuit's backpack and it marks when you're inventory is full. When you buy a new ship, everything on your old ship is lost, and there are no warning messages to this fact. So the thousands of minerals you had saved up: they're wiped. There are many other things the game just doesn't tell you. The UI is made for the controller, so expect to move around sluggishly.You need an open inventory slot to see what you CAN craft. So you often have to destroy an upgrade just to see if you've collected enough stuff for another upgrade, then build both. This is so unbelievably stupid. The combat is meaningless. Sentinels pose zero threat. They always arrive in exactly the same manner in the same numbers. Ship to ship combat isn't dogfighting, it's jousting. And its a snore, because you can (and indeed have to) open your inventory and restore power to your shields. It's a nuisance. Attacking freighters doesn't garner you anything you cannot find on a planet, yet here the sentinel force is very aggressive. Some planets are very hostile, with bad weather, angry sentinels who shoot on sight, but there is no risk-reward equivalency so you're better off on another planet with better weather and more docile security - the resources will most likely be the same. To avoid exposure damage from extreme heat, cold, poison or radiation, you can go into a cave. I didn't know that simply by walking into a cave, radiation is avoided. Good to know.When you blow up terrain, or mine minerals, rocks routinely hang in there air where they were before you shot them. When you blow ups storage tanks with your land deforming grenades, the exploded tanks hover in the air defying gravity. Planets don't revolve around the sun. Moons don't revolve around the planets. Space Stations don't orbit. Freighters don't move. And when you're on a planet, there is a day night cycle, but it's a skybox not actual physics which Murray proudly touted it would be.Weather is a full planet event. Except if you climb back into your starship. Then there is no weather. Until you climb out later somewhere hundreds of kilometres away, then there is the same weather. Procedurally generated animals that all look like the same, and often look incredibly ugly. Take Head #168, attach to Body #43, with Legs #98... colour it all the same colour, and then give it a walk cycle. No big animals. No exotic 300 metre long sand worms, and nothing as majestic as seen in the trailer. Also, all animals clip through you and the terrain. The animation quality of the animals varies from passable to downright ridiculous. Can you see animals from the air? Only if they spawned when you were on the ground. When you get back in and fly away, they'll remain at that spot, but if you fly too far away they disappear. The pop in in this game is awesome. Even in space, where there are literally only a couple of textured orbs (as planets) and a space station, the asteroids pop in 50m away from you. When flying on the surface of the planet, its often very hard to tell what is what, because the terrain is deforming as it redraws itself as you get closer. No multiplayer. Not that I actually care about this one, but it was said to exist and it simply doesn't. The Galactic Core. The big mystery at the end. There isn't one. I feel like Damen Lindelof wrote the ending. It's a mess folks. And then it's just buggy as hell: Crashes to desktop. UI icons appearing where they shouldn't appear. Incorrect equipment popups. Obvious ship asset swaps during warps. Launching from a planet can sometimes shoot you up thousands of kilometres into space. You can fall through the ground. Corrupted save files. You receive upgrades which then don't appear in your inventory. Weapon art toggle mix ups where it thinks its using the laser, but the bolt caster icon is highlighted and vice versa. Animals spinning on the heads. Framerate issues, even with the recommended system settings & more!Sean Murray has joined the illustrious company of Randy Pitchford (Alien: Colonial Marines), and Peter Molyneux (Fable) as a game developer who, for one reason or another, didn't deliver on his spectacular vision. Avoid."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 13, 2016              Ok first off, this is coming from someone who knew nothing of NMS other than seeing it way back when at E3.I was not hyped about the game, and never looked too deeply into what the game was about. Other than knowing it was a procedurally generated space sim / adventure.So I have played a fair few hours now, 100% on the original planet and warped 20 or so times. Been to quite a few plannets and stations.Here are my thought's, so far. Because if a game cant grip you from the start, then.....First off when you first enter the game it looks beautiful. I like collecting all the data and i like the concept of gathering all the materials you need to repair and craft things for you and your ship. This is kind of the main problem of the game,Although the inventory managment seems more of an annoyance than a challenge. Having to scrap things you find just to open a box to see what is inside. Just to find out its the same trinket you just dropped. There does not seem to be anything intresting in any crate I found.I mostly enjoyed finding the ancient alien artifacts that offer bits of story.After the first 3 hours after I got used to my environment  collecting  everything became quite tedious. It tells you nothing of where you need to go or what you need to get.I understand it is a sandboxy kind of a game with a small bit of story in order to call it a  game  But nothing from the first planet you are on pushes you to go further. When you are on the first planet you can not open certain boxes due not not having a V1 Atlass Pass (whatever that is). It tells you nothing of what this is or how to aquire it. I only later aquired it by randomly warping around. I got bored near the end of my first planet because there seemed nothing new. Yes you can fly around investigating the ? But what is the point? they are just re-colored versions of what you have already explored.There is no  real  threat, this was very important to me, I wanted to see a hostile planet, where the animals hunted each other, the animals attacked you etc..There is none of that really, the only threat you have are from the drones that are too easy to kill and usually do not even attack you unless you engage first.You cant even kill yourself from falling off a cliff.Danger in the game is more  passive  threat, I.e Radiation etc that you never die of just makes you use more of your resources.I felt like I was playing in god mode, When you meet your first alien I would expect an interesting confrontation, but no they just sit in there chair and most of the time don't even acknowledge that a strange unknown species has just walked straight into there house. The conversation options with said aliens are shallow and offer nothing, the only reason to go to these places is to get a new weapon that they tend to have on the wall.The whole  Universe  just seems dead and shallow. Animals that run around with no AI. Supposedly intelligent aliens that I would imagine in reality to be very rare, they are everywhere, and are as shallow as quest NPC's in an MMO.So after leaving your first planet, you're hyped to explore a space station? a new planet?You go to a space station that is massive and looks cool, you enter the docking port go through the door, and you're greeted by yet another  Intelligent  alien sat in a chair, offers nothing different than the other aliens on the planet.Where are all the people in this space station? why is it so big? God knows, its just 1 dude in a chair in a little room.So new planet?Infinite possibility? No. I entered my second planet to find the same more or less creatures even the same models used just with different colors. [Edit]I have since tried to play more to get my money's worth. And I stand by my original opinion. There is far to much of the same thing repeated over and over. You go to a new plannet and half the plants look the same, the background sounds of animals is the same for every planet. It says allot when the game itself is only 2.5GB of how the assets in the game are repeated.The payoff of reaching the center of the universe by grinding through these same color shifted planets is not enough for me.So should you buy NMS? No, not now.Wait for if and when its an actual game.Seems more of a tech demo right now.What happened to the times when you bought a game, and that was it. It was a complete game.Today when you buy a game you buy a into a concept, that they can add too if they want or most of the time just leave as it is.10/10 for the idea2/10 for the execution"

I don't think its totally the developers fault. I had high hopes for this game but the inventory game and repetitiveness wore on me quickly. I do wish that steam would give a person longer to see if a game is worth their money, but in the end all I have learned is to listen more to the reviews (I waited for a week to see what the reviews came in at and still bought it) I think that your money could be spent on a better game!"

The only other hilariously comparative venture I've seen to date has been Star Citizen, except that this game has actually released.  The amount of hype surrounding the game was immense, the trailers were amazing, the promises were ...promising.  Just enough to make you want the game.  And it worked.  A lot of people did buy the game.  The joke is, that there's JUST ENOUGH content to take you just beyond steam's 2-hour refund cut-off.  At least by now most people are aware that it's absolutely horrific, in terms of games with a price tag usually present on a-class productions (fallout, witcher, elder scrolls, souls games, etc)  I feel ripped off for having pre-ordered this, and I feel foolish for having been so happy when telling friends that I'd pre-ordered it."

The developers should have made sure it was clear that the game boils down to jumping from repetitive planet to repetitive planet, until you reach the center. But details were intentionally vague. Sad.This has reinforced a valuable lesson. Wait until AFTER release to buy, regardless of how big the hype train is.Amazing...even after all this time, still full price.

You aren't meant to have all the game offers at your finger tips the minute you start playing, or even within the first few hours, and the player is well aware of that. So a lot of these reviewers, like me (26 hours played), took their time, went exploring, always expecting to find bigger and better things, expecting to find those  promised features  that weren't there. In fact, we sunk hours in trying to recharge our hyper drives so we could travel to new solar systems and see if that's where the fun was. All the while the game just kept getting more and more frustrating and dissapointing until we finally realize that there is nothing more. It turns out that the enitre game WAS at our fingure tips in the first minute. So don't think people are being hypocritical or that they truly did get their money's worth when they have 10, 15, 20, 40 hours of gameplay and leave a negative review. And don't buy this game. Get 4 or 5 other indie games totalling the same price.TL;DR = You have to explore to realize there's nothing to find. Negative reviews with lots of play hours really know what they're talking about."

I survived Star Wars:Galaxies and a number of questionable launches of other games including Eve, but No Man's Sky has to have plumbed new depths of software that wasn't ready for prime time. More fool I, perhaps - no open beta, tightly lipped team, but so many promises! And I wanted to believe, I really did. It took me a while to be able to play this game; I have a Phenom and Hello didn't do a beta or clearly test on AMDs because the game didn't work, and those of us with AMD Phenoms had to use a workaround using an Intel emulator in order to play, (player suggested workaround too), at a reduced framerate. I should add Hello was HORRIBLE with communication - Sean (the owner), posted they were working on a fix and then went dark for 48 hours, no updates on where they were, no status of the fix, until finally some people on Steam boards saw a build pushed to experimental, which got you farther but not to the planet. Enter the emulator workaround, then FINALLY more info from Sean they were going to make people happy with a fix, but still no concrete info on it. The final injustice in all this is apparently Hello is already working on another game! Despite this 'premium' title not containing the features promised, despite its problems and unfinished feel, they've used my money to move on. I feel cheated. The game doesn't deliver on what it was promised - it feels more like a sandbox or alpha game, incomplete, than a $60 title. You hunt around and salvage parts to repair your ship after being stranded on a planet, attune to a mysterious stone, maybe encounter an alien or two, and then go to a station to sell. There are so few NPCs that it feels the place isn't populated. You should get nudged for a mission that will grant you a hyperdrive, (I haven't yet), but if you pre-ordered you already have one, so it doesn't make sense. I repaired my ship, found a trader on the planet I was on, then found a station off planet and interacted with a device in the wall and sold some ore... and then what? Your cargo bay is small, stacks are 250, there is no inventory and no direction. It looks okay - I mean procedurally generated terrain is fine and all, but I can't play it. I don't mind open world games like Skyrim - there you have content, quests, NPCs, etc., but No Man's Sky doesn't have any of that feel. It is a boring game with poor support at an expensive price and I cannot recommend it, despite the fact I try my hardest to support small studios."

There is no indication whatsoever that this was anything but intentional. The complete lack of contrition or any resemblance of empathy for the huge portion of people who feel cheated is staggering.The core gameplay loop doesn't change through the entirety of the game after the starter planet. Play for an hour, explore the place and you've literally seen 100% of what the game has to offer. The only differences are palette-swapped planets populated by random abominations. Ship anything is a steaming garbage fire. Even with a mod that improves planetary flight it's still absolutely terrible. The space combat doesn't even rate as a bad joke. I wasn't expecting Elite Dangerous or anything, but this is honestly just sad. Inventory management is just ridiculous. If there was more than five minutes spent on the entire inventory/upgrade system I would be both surprised and astonished. It's the kind of shallow, simplistic annoyance you find in a mobi or web game. Not a $60  AAA  title.Not for nothing, but if you talk about features on the Tonight Show, you probably should at least pretend to have them in the game.Edit: There is no special Steam refund circumstances. If you were dumb enough to put more than two hours in under the false assumption that it gets better, you're out $60. Lesson learned -- never pre-order!If HelloGames hasn't completely abandoned the game as a hype-train cash-grab it might be worth trying again in a year. Until then, run away. Run far, far away."

I know games are hard to make, I'm making one myself with rpg maker mv. But seriously Hello Games. For your first throw into the gaming industry I think you should have given this a lot more effort. With Star Citezen's recent game footage, NMS is looking like a pretty heavy fail in the long run. Unless efforts are made to deliver the product promised before launch, I don't think anyone will ever change their opinion of this highly ambitious title.

The games have to have a very big impact for me to have a comment about them, and this is one that had a very negative impact.No Man's Sky. When I saw the trailer six months ago, I was estatic. When I saw footage of the gameplay that Hello Games promised, I was filled with such excitement and hype that I wished the game was out at that very moment. I waited, patiently, for the first release date, June 21st. And waited. And just before it was about to be released, the date was pushed back. Uh oh. By then, I had already heard news about some issues the developers were having, and I thought,  Okay, it still is going to be a good game.. It just, needs some work!  and when it was released on August 9th, I downloaded it very quickly.The presentation was nice. I'll give Hello Games that. They promised a multitude of things. True multiplayer, for one, was a very large letdown. There is no social interaction on any planet at all, other than the creatures you may discover, and the NPC trading ships flying about occasionally. Classes were to be treated as a sole profession. That, say you wanted to be a pirate. Fly around and plunder space. Well you still need to go down to a planet to gather resources to repair and fly your ship. You don't have your own true, customizable experience in-game.You were promised you could discover ships, and name them, and that there were different kinds of ships that were built for exploration, or speed. Well I can tell you firsthand that isn't the case. Speed in this game seems almost irrelevant.Factions. This was a huge part of the game I was looking forward to. It was promised that, as we watched two warring factions duke it out in some of the YouTube teaser videos, that we could  join in  and  take sides . Factions exist. But not at that grand of a scale. You don't get a massive reward for helping out some pirates, or perhaps saving a massive cargo ship from destruction, other than some resources you get for destroying them. There is no way to have a hateful faction against you in this game, and increasing your standing is just a  feel good  text, that really doesn't have any effect.Complex crafting. Murray told the people  we're just letting players loose, and, a little bit like Minecraft, people can figure out those rules for themselves.  Nowhere near close to true. Murray said,  When we release the game, we're not telling people 'here are all the formulas.  I'm not one for accusation, but each crafting  recipe  is told by the game what resource you need, and finding it is really... abundant. There is no sort of Minecraft feel to it at all, unless you are talking about being able to destroy the rocks with a grenade. Sure, it's a different sort of take on crafting, but it really seems like Hello Games took after Destiny. They created such a large hype for such a low, undermade game. I don't like games like this, and this will definintely make me think a loooong time before ever pre-ordering again. 4 hours of this game, and I haven't fully explored one planet yet. I haven't even used the hyperdrive. Because I know what this game is going to be like. One planet after the next. Flying every so often, landing, fueling up, discovering some things, and then taking off once more, going to yet another planet, and somehow, eventually, making your way to the center of the universe. There is no real goal in this game. There is no enjoyment. Not for someone like me.http://www.ibtimes.com/no-mans-sky-5-awesome-features-were-removed-ps4pc-game-release-2403324 (This link was helpful in making this review.)"

That said, I'm already addicted and can see myself pouring hundreds of hours into this game without breaking a sweat. There are a variety of missions/activities to take on, and the resource gathering isn't mindless (i.e. you need to strategize what you need, how many you can carry, what it will create, and how that benefits you). There are also virtually unlimited planets and ships - plus the music is procedurally generated. :)Looking forward to continued updates, of course, but this is well worth the purchase."

I am thinking that they might add some features as paid DLCs, but that's not the way. Pretty boring game with no goal or purpose. PC release is a poor console port. I'm really dissapointed with NMS."

I played the first release version again recently and it really is such a hugh difference.The game now is much tigher,  the graphics are superb, the story line is slowly getting there, and the overall framerate problems are pretty much gone.  If you have a decent graphics card, the game really looks gorgeous from the way the NPCs race charactrers look,  to the terrain, to the outer space experience..  Also, the planet generation and biomes are pretty awesome now.   I was very disappointed when the game came out, but it really is a different game now and I recommend giving it another try.   I also commend the team for not just throwing their hands up and saying the heck with it.  They really do show a commitment and love for the game.  Of course, Gareth Bourn, the creator of the game, is not a great spokesperson and I think we all acknowledge that, but he's trying to improve so props to him for trying."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 21, 2018              I've got memories of playing games like this when I was a kid. At this point in time, with a couple solid content updates under it's belt, No Man's Sky reminds me most of a game called Freelancer. I bought Freelancer many years ago at an Office Max for the price of $10. Back then, I was totally unaware of the hype culture surrounding Freelancer, so when I played it I had no expectations and no context for what I later learned was a dissapointment of a game for many, Without all that, Freelancer was one of my favorite games. I sunk dozens of hours into it after school, exploring the galaxy, getting into dog fights, trading, and performing missions. In retrospect, Freelancer probably wasn't as good as I remember it being. Thinking about it now though, even knowing that it can't match the memories, I have an urge to install it and play more. It was my first taste of the fantastical freedom that video games could offer.Had I known about the troubled development of Freelancer, maybe I wouldn't have bought so hard into the hype for No Man's Sky. Rewatching the promotional material, it's obvious to see the cracks in Sean Murray's passionate extolling of his baby. Looking back, I can see that No Man's Sky was never meant to be what it was sold as, it was the dream of an indie team and nothing more or less. Unfortunately, that dream was corrupted, pimped out, and sold for $60 on launch.Had I not bought so strongly into the hype, and had I not spent 60 of my hard earned dollars, I would have been satisfied with what I got. But, now, replaying it a year and a half later, I see the vision the developers had for the game becoming reality. With the pain of betrayal and a decent chunk of money gone, I can peek behind the product and see the dream. And I really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing like it.Don't get me wrong, $60 for this game is absurd. It's not worth $60. It's also not worth $15. No Man's Sky is in the rarely seen category of having vast potential, but not fulfilling it. The game is broad as an ocean, but deep as a glass of water. No mechanic is intentionally deep, though some poor design choices sometimes make things more difficult than they need to be. But, all of those mechanics are entertaining.No Man's Sky was, and continues to be a disappointment if you look at it through the lens of the marketing. If you look at it with a clean slate, with no context, with the attitude of a boy with a bit of cash inhis pocket, this game is a dream come true. There's worlds you can explore, exen if they're all similar to an extent, there's animals to discover, even if they too fall into a limited box of variety, and there's ancient secrets to discover, even if the discoveries are often underwhelming.The real value of No Man's Sky is hard to calculate. A real passion was put into this game, but that passion was perverted at some point and used to present this game as something it's not. The passion alone is apparent in many aspects of this game, but it didn't completely translate to software. The game itself can stand sturdily on it's own merits, but again that foundation has been eaten away by termites. $10 is an absolute steal, $20 is great value, $30 is a decent price, $40 is something I'd pay, and $50+ is not reasonable. In all honesty, this game doesn't have a wide appeal. The dogfights are often clunky, there's too much weight to movements, and the FOV doesn't allow for good spatial awareness. However, there's a real, true, genuinely fun experience to be had here. If you're like me and found a deep love of games like Freelancer, without the baggage of hype. If you remember this game's release, but didn't follwo the hype. Even if you think you might be remotely interested in this sort of thing; you should get this game.You should get this game.Really, what I'm doing here is not reviewing the mechanics, gameplay, graphical quality, or the story. I'm reviewing the feeling of the game. It gives me a wonderful nostalgic peaceful feeling to play this game. It gives me an oportunity to re-experience fond memories of a fantasy science fiction world.Hello games birthed a dissapointment into the world, but from what I can see, they've done a damn good job of making that dissapointing baby grow up into a fundamentally pleasant person. I'm sure there's an absolute ton of reviews going over every other aspect of this game, and you should absolutely look at those. But, just remember, to really enjoy this game you need to ignore the hype and buy it on sale.To address my largest concern with the game: It's a grind. You're constantly required to do some kind of busywork to keep yourself alive, and keep yourself spacebound. However, there is always a path to minimizing these annoyances. Perservere through the first few tough hours, and qality of life will improve. It's a game like runescape, in that you need to constantly be aware of a goal, and that goal will require effort to achieve, but once you finaly make it, it feels good, and has an obvious reward.I don't love this game, But, respect the love put in, the effort to follow through, and really really like it.On an emotional scale of 1-10, with 10 being absolute infatuation and 5 as an average, I give this an 8.5/10.On an objective mechanics scale of 1-10, with the same criteria as above, I give this a 6/10.I think you should buy this game, at whatever sale price you think is appropriate, and I think you should definitely forget the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t marketing hype train. Give it a chance with a clean slate and I think you'll have an at least pleasant time."

Despite it's enourmous flop at launch; They have, rather than just quietly distancing themselves from this game like many studios would've done, continued to pour more and more effort into this game. It's even even getting good now; Thanks to the huge amount of effort on Hello Games part. If you are one of the many that refunded this game shortly after launch then please give this game a second chance, give it a go again and just see how much it improved since launch and reconsider wether or not this game and the amounts of dedication being put into it are worth your money now."

Stayed in the first universe for a long time getting my suit and ship upgraded thinking that was the only thing about the game I didn't like was the poor inventory . Unfortunately that made my game time go up to much for a refund . Beyond the initial universe there is no reason to explore further . The wonder of new animals , planets , and aliens goes away when the scripting reuses itself almost immediately. And have fun resetting the game every 10 mins to do away with the mountains of issues . For me the biggest being a sudden slow motion effect leaving you to crawl to a saving point for a few minutes before alt f4 spamming and reloading the game . There's withheld content , presumably for a dlc you have to buy separate  , and the no loading screen thing is very cute .. Instead you get a color screen with no loading bar . Also the preorder ship made it so I couldn't even experience the atlas path .. So there goes the only story the game had to offer .. Not that I missed much I hear . Makes me sick that again game developers would let big money like Sony push(/rush) their small impressive project to the 60$ main title market and only have lies to back up what they where offering ."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 22, 2016              Alright, now I've only ever written a review for Life Is Strange. That game absolutely deserved it, and so does NMS, but for the exact opposite reason.Look, I enjoy the game, and I like the idea, but jesus christ this is just pathetic, and I can't recommend it to anyone in its current state. It's playable, and has its fun moments, but really I wouldn't buy it unless you're dead set on it, in which a review wont change your mind. Definitely not for the price it's at either.It's a space exploration game, but I have absolutely no desire to be in space or even in my ship. The controls for flying are HORRIBLE, the ship speeds are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying (basically like 1mph, 5mph, and 100mph), and space battles justâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off and I can't imagine anyone finding them even the least bit fun. If you're flying in pulse mode (basically planet to planet warp speed) and hostile ships detect your  rare items  (you can literally have nothing in your inventories and they'll still detect you...), it tears you out of pulse mode and forces you to fight them. You can't re-enter pulse or warp away to escape, and can't travel fast enough to ever escape unless you happen to be close enough to a planet or space station. Then with the pathetic controls, if there's a handful of ships attacking you you're basically screwed because they can somehow fly much faster than you and it's extremely difficult to even hit one. Oh, and your shield depletes way too quick and you have to sort through menus in real time to recharge it, with elements you either don't have or can't find in space, only on land. So you have no choice but to die basically.And that happens a lot if you spend time in space.Also I have a very highly upgraded ship that was like 47 million credits that has 46 inventory slots, so good luck with any ship.So that leaves running around on planets as the only  chill, relaxing  thing to do basically. Which I actually enjoy. Really, that part of the game is fun. However, there's a few things there thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off as well.1. Literally every planet is inhabited. (Probably by other players too if you could actually see them) Theres some sort of sign of civilization every couple minutes of walking distance in every direction. Which is fine in terms of playing, it gives me something to head for and explore rather than just walking around on the dull landscapes. But when it's supposed to feel like you're exploring new territory, planets being overrun with shelters, trade stations, monoliths, etc. ruin that narrative.2. About 95% of the planets I've visited have been some sort of barren hazardous bullâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Whether it's ice, radiation, heat, or poison, it's literally all the same. I have to run indoors or shoot my own shelter in a hill every 10-20 seconds to keep my hazard support from running out. That's not fun, that's just annoying and it makes me go to a different planet. And the nice planets I have found that I do want to explore are devoid of anything worth exploring. There's never any rare resources, hardly even any animals, and again I just go and find another planet.3. Sentries are a decent concept, but honestly they should be removed completely. Again, it ruins that whole  discovering planets for the first time  thing, and they do nothing but prevent me from doing what the game says I'm supposed to do. 4. When discount GLADoS from portal says  incoming storm , you have straight up zero time to get anywhere. The storm hits as soon as it finishes warning you.5. I like the idea of unique animals, but they could have actually just dedicated a couple weeks to designing the animals themselves so that they make sense, because most just look stupid. I don't care if that means theres only a few thousand animals versus however many there are, it would look better that way. An extension of that, some of the ships are ridiculous as well, but I am glad that inventory space is not related to size of the ship because I wanted a small ship not two sideways grain silos with a cockpit thrown on top.6. Even though every planet is unique, it all seems the same. There's basically a handful of environments that all look and interact the same, the only difference is the shape of the landscape and where things are.Really though, it is a bit of fun and it's worth trying, but not at 60 dollars. They have a lot of work to do to make this even a good game, and I do look foward to the updates they'll apparently be making (if they try to make any of it paid DLC though I wouldn't be suprised if they have to change their names and move to remote locations).Bottom line is, don't expect to be blown away or even impressed, but it's a nice concept and might eventually evolve into something worth half its price."

I've never tried harder to like a game in my life. I hopped on the hype train at their e3 trailer. I knew this game would be someting else, and it most defenitly was.The sense of direction they've given you is very minor, almost non existant. You mine some stuff. get rid of some stuff to mine more stuff. Bring it to your ship and off you go to another planet. There's no building you can do, you can't inhabit a planet. You're lost. you have a ship and whatever you can find to survive. Good parts about this game, though.-Amazing soundtrack.-You won't do much/any backtracking- Can prove a challenge- Freaking MASSIVEBad parts-Not for everyone- Hype train ruined what was supposed to be a small exploration game- Repetitive- Planets are re-skinned and the animals ARE NOT what you see in the trailer.All in all the game isn't bad, but isn't great. There are multiple games i would reccomend before No Mans Sky. This is also not worth the 60 dollars. 30 would be a reasonable price range."

Not only were the graphics in my opinion 'meh!', but there was stuttering and drop in framerates constantly, no crashes tho.Back to the game itself;Pros -- Huge Number of explorable planets- fly to other 'Planets'- fly to other 'Galaxies'Cons -- Galaxy's/solar systems are just a small 'skybox'- Space ships and their configurations are very repetitive- Space Ships are NOT upgradable, can only buy new ones.....- Resources grind fest(ever played WoW and killed 100 boars to ding, this is the same thing but no ding)- No Goals(except flying to centre of Universe with the worst ending)- No logging, by this I mean once you leave your starter planet you have no way of finding out what planet you started on.Thats about all I have currently, except this-DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IN THE CURRENT STATE! ! !"

It's just so incredibly boring and nothing ever really happens. None of the lore is very interesting or intriguing and the supposed AI is sevearly lacking as far as the creatures and pretty much everything else goes for that matter. Sadly I cannot refund this game at this point, I have very little hope for it ever being improved with updates. Not wasting my time with it anymore, definitely buy something else for the current price point."

This game went from a game I tried to defend to being a game that I believe deserves a lawsuit. Absolute disappointment. It's nice visually for a couple of hours but once you realize every planet has the same planets, the same minerals, and all you do is land, collect, take off, land, collect , repeat repeat repeat you will understand the frustration. There are about 5 different alien npc's in 3 races. Every space station looks EXACTLY the same, and there's no point to having infinite planets if there's 6 different kinds that feel the same. Awesome concept, but HORRIBLY executed. Please save your money."

Anyone considering buying it at this point hasn't seen any of the news about the massive disappointment that No Man's Sky has brought onto the world.There are less and less people playing this game every day, and there is a reason for it; it sucks!Rather than paying any amount of money, you would be better off sending me your cash in exchange for a huge bucket of monkey crap. You would be far less disappointed and have 10x the fun, then use what ever is left over to fertilize you lawn.There were over 212,000 people playing this game when it came out.

This game should have been delayed much longer instead of shoveling out a half done alpha of a game. Yes i did played it for 29hrs but like most people I thought it will get better through progression and exploration, but nope it just gave me a massive middle finger infront of my face every time i warp into another solar system, or i scan something new, or even buy a new spaceship only realizing this is the same crap over and over again and there isn't much to do.I would ONLY recommend this game if is SUPER heavily discounted (less than 15$) or to make the true promised features come alive from the lack of current content through updates and patches, but that will be very unlikely to arise through the coming weeks or even months."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 15, 2016              Unfortunately, I still have to say that I do not recommend this game. They were going in the right direction. They have added multiplayer, which is nice, though I haven't really tested it. Before the update, whenever someone else was in the same planet or had left a monument, the game would lag like crazy, only achieving 30FPS max, even when you left the system. Hopefully, that was fixed, but I do not know.Now on to why I really don't recommend this game. Originally it was pretty grindy already. Unfortunately, they turned the grind up even more. I tried playing it for a bit just today and got bored because everything takes a bunch of time and resources. Need a certain resource? chances are you'll have to refine it. Which takes time. Want to upgrade your backpack? Not only do you have to find the upgraders on the planet, you have to fix them now instead of paying credits.It did not help too that they basically restructured almost every single system in the game. Ship upgrades, exosuit upgrades, weapon upgrades, crafting, gatherable elements, bases, planets, etc. Which means if you had a save already, it might almost be better to restart. Almost like a data wipe for early access. Now, of course, you have to grind out a specific currency called Nanites twhich you get from interacting with different items to get back to where you were. They also tuned up the graphics, which would be nice if I could turn more stuff off. It was a resource hog already, and tuning up the graphics only made it worse. I'm running low and it's still taxing.Lastly, how sentinels spawn now is immensely annoying. They spawn out of the ground at seemingly random times just off the side of your screen. And while they are within range, even if they aren't angry at you, you'll have a white reticle pointing to where they are. Honestly, if they aren't readying  up to attack me, I really couldn't care where they are. So overall, I just don't think it's worth the grind. I wanted an upgrade from the previous version. What I got I feel like was the opposite. Rather than being interested in playing the game, it feels bland, boring, and like a chore. Previous ReviewWith the update they pushed out late November, things have gotten quite a bit better. Planets now actually look different than just tan/brown balls with some highlights when you get close. I actually came across a completely snow covered planet with colorful fauna like I expected from the pre-release video.They also added a few new modes, Survival and Creative. I haven't played creative yet, but that would be useful if you just want to build a cool base. (I may do it to see if I can link two planets. Survival is pretty difficult. It is harder than normal and you have to keep watch over your resources and vitals carefully. It took me about an hour and a half to get to my ship. Expect to punch a bunch of rocks and walk alot as running and jumping eat suit resources like crazy. Also, staying out in space is a bad idea, I had barely any goods on my ship worth selling and 4 pirates showed up to ruin my day.I haven't done much for base building, but there is content there for that as well. In order to completely upgrade your base you will have to find the resources for it. I only build 3 modules, so I don't know much about it. Also, Frieghters cost about 2-3 Million for a basic one.Overall, it's progress, and I'm glad Hello Games is still sticking behind the game. I've seen the reviews percentage increase from 20% positive overall to 31% overall, which is substantial when it has 80k+ reviews. However, I still do not believe it offers enough content to justify a $60 price-point. Better than before, but still not enough.Previous Previous Review:It is with a heavy heart that I choose to not recommend this game. It had looked cool in all the pre-release videos. I stuck with it while it had a shaky start, as most games do. Unfortunately, after stepping back and looking at it. This isn't a full game. It's more like an alpha or beta product. For $60, I cannot recommend this product in this state. Perhaps if and when they add the content missing from what I would consider the full game, I can recommend the game, but until then, I suggest looking for a different game to scratch your space-sim itch. This just does not have the content."

Procedural generation is the only real feature of this game to keep you playing since there isn't much to do in this game besides explore. Yet exploring becomes mundane as all the fauna, flora, and landscapes are nearly identical. There is no possiblility of finding unique geographical structures akin to Mount Everest. Although this game was very pretty and had interesting mechanics i felt that between the features that were promised and my actual gameplay there is a lot of work to do. It isn't very enjoyable for $60. You'll be lucky to get as many hours as i did before you discover everything you need to know about this game."

False advertising, precisely catered assets arranged in ways you will never find them in game. It pains me to do this, but as long as they keep advertising this game with media that is not representitive of the actual game, I can't in good conscience give it a positive review.The irony of the situation is that if this game had released with no fanfare, no hype, no press, and no promises, I believe it would have been quite well recieved. Myself honestly, I am having an okay time. I paid for the game, and will get what enjoyment I can out of it. It's not a bad game after all. It's pretty chill, and every now and then I found a world that really impressed me, and I spent hours just wandering and exploring. The technology at work here is pretty impressive, and although most of the features seem to have been dumbed down considerably, it is still a worthwhile experience if the loop of harvesting and crafting for its own sake appeals to you. If only there was a bit more progression. Something to change the game up a bit. But I was mining iron and plutonium during my first hour, and 20,000 light years later I have basically all the tech and a huge ship, and I am still mostly just mining iron and plutonium. At first the creatures, despite being far less diverse and complex than promised, occasionally surprise me. However, after a dozen planets I realized I'd pretty much seen everything.Still, if this sounds like your thing, there is a lot to like here. Just keep in mind that you might get something different from what was advertised.Oh, also the current version's performance is garbage."

When you first start playing, everything is so fresh and exciting, like buying a freighter or discovering a new planet.After a while it all gets incredibly repetetive and flying around space feels more like a chore than a game. Once landing on a planet, you have to spend three hours mindlessly shooting rocks and looking for plutonium just to leave so you can repeat the process on a different planet.Overall, it's a fun time-waster, but not a game to get invested in."

It seems extremely short-sighted in its design, from the fact that by my 10th hyper-jump, I'm already feeling like I've done it all before, and really can't be arsed doing it again, with all the resource grinding and inventory juggling required to get from one planet to the next. Some people have  joked  that this was an early-access dressed-up as full release, and that is *exactly* what it feels like. In over 30 years of buying games, I doubt I've ever felt so cheated.

Lets take Taurus the company that makes guns as an example. Their line of weaponry sucked butt when they came out. Just recently they made a gem. Even though its a nice gun, a tarnished history leaves their future earnings in the hands of S&W, while a decently old gun still out sales their best product to date. This is kind of the same. This was released a horrid mess, patched half assedly, and still a miserable far cry from its publicized, and promised version. 60$ for a game with no story, and no co-op. Lets not support these companies who promise the world and give you a kiddy pool. And for those who are salty about this review, shove it up where the sun don't shine. Get the wet paper bag off your head and look at the majority of these reviews. Well over half of the negative reviews are for legit reasons."

Naturally, after the years of hype, the Internet kind of did what it did best and roasted Hello Games over a firepit.  But then, Hello Games did something unusual.They got up, they dusted themselves off, got the smoke out of their collective hair, and got to work.  Over the next two years, we saw the base-building update, then Atlas Rising re-did the storyline from the ground up, and NEXT came in and finally, finally, two years post-release, for a game that could've easily been written off, shoved under the rug, and moved on from, No Man's Sky is actually quite good.  It resembles what we saw in the trailers now, and I'm happy to say that if you've been on the fence, if you've heard the bad initial press, that No Man's Sky has recovered, reinvented itself, and made one hell of a comeback."

The fact that Steam are refusing refunds after 2hours in game this vast is a pretty big slap in the face to every customer who preordered this game expecting it to be like the videos portray.Preorder a large game again using store page as a buying guide? Never again through Steam. Steam and Hello (we lie about) Games have now put me off preordering any game for the forseeable future.As bad a release as Sim City. Recieved worse customer service from Steam than EA, who while refusing to refund, did at least give out a choice of free games to apologise. Although obviously a refund would have been the ethical thing to do and far better customer service.In 15 years of gaming this is the first time I feel really conned by a purchase and a company."

Everything else (combat, exploration, even the procedural generation) is just shallow and repetitive. Expect to see LOTS of similar looking plants, animals, planets, mineral veins, ships, etc.Overall the game is fun for the first 10 or so hours, since everything feels new at first and you don't really find out about the false advertising until later. Personally, I flat out couldn't play it anymore after 22 hours because it's so damn repetitive.The bottom line is that this game isn't early as enormous or complex as it was made out to be, and it shouldn't cost more than 20 dollars in its current form."

Graphics are nothing compared to other games of this day and age, and the gameplay mechanics are very basic. The real problem, it wasn't any fun after a few hours. There is NO story. Nothing to motivate you or keep you going. You are stuck in endless repitition. Every planet, you harvest so that you can upgrade or repair your ship, go to another planet and do the same thing over again. The repition is boring after the first few planets. Exploring is about your only option, but I was not ever motivated since every planet looks the same.I feel like this would appeal to a very specific group, who love this genre; but for most gamers skip it or wait until it's like $10."

The draw distance is far too short for this scale and things became barren landscape  or a mirage if you had already mined it.  Questionable design choices everywhere.  Navigation is terrible there is no maps at all just local star systems view.   You have to select only star systems linked to current viewed one, no searching or selecting anything you haven't played connect the dots to.  Factions are completely hollow, not much incentive to interact and you can't side/join with any of them.  No story, and the ending is worse than sopranos.  Combat encounters are random pirates or simply you'reâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off the sentinels for doing something harmless to anyone.  There's no real combat either with only 1 weapon active at once on foot or in ship, enemy ai is dumb as can be with aimbot.  Terrible UI everywhere, the only info you get is resource types detected from personal scanner or a random waypoint you must visit before another can be discovered with ship scanner.  Tedious repetitive resource gathering with painfully small inventory.  Increasing inventory is only goal you work toward, constantly recharging life support or shielding with your resources as it falls like a stone in hazardous environments or space combat.  In spite of procedural generation the planet's all start to feel the same with the monolith resources and repeating structures & hollow ecosystems.  Interacting with someone or something takes forever with lengthy camera changes & hold mouse/button down to confirm every single selection including in option menus.  Runs smoothly after very long loading time then without warning or reason frames drop to a couple fps, recovered only when restart.  In short, no man's sky is a nice attempt at pushing the envelope in scale but falls far short or just breaks all its promises.  Too early release, not enough features were added and testing was done."

I saw some gameplay and thought it might be up my open world alley when I read the Steam page.  While NMS not the worst thing I have ever bought over my gaming life, but itâs not near good either. This game is just plainly mediocre. Choppy frame rates, really repetitive game play, subpar inventory system, not much to do after maxing out the inventory slots on the ship, gun and your suit, clunky galaxy map, and a lack of a basic nav system. Really, you are supposed to be travelling around the universe and you donât even have a compass. This makes exploring a pain in the rear. On the plus side, when the game isnât skipping like a grade school girl, some of the art is very well done. Some of the planets I have visited are very surreal and pleasant to look at. Some of the animals look good. The motion of leaving the planet and entering space is almost seamless. This, however, is kind of ruined when you enter the rock garden of asteroids that is around every planet in every system I been too. Makes me wonder how there is any life in this game with this much rock floating around. It can be a very relaxing experience, but, the more I think about it, it borders on tedium. I swear if I still smoked this would be a better game in my eyes. The endless mind numbing grinding, mining and crafting stuff that doesnât change any of the visuals or, in the slightest, changes the environment makes it seem like you really are not making any progress or difference. As far as game play in the current state, this is a walking sim. I like games I can explore, but there has to be a point to the exploration. There is a lot of a little. A little bit of survival, a little bit of trading, a little bit of intelligent aliens, a little bit of story, a little bit of combat, a little bit of lifeforms, a little bit of variation, and a little bit crafting.  Nothing is fleshed out just a lot of a little. Maybe with in the year this might change. Maybe this will give it the love, devotion and more depth that should have been given at release. I cannot recommend this game at this current price point of 60$. Wait for a 66% off or better. To Hello Games, thank you for trying. To me, itâs Goodbye Gamer. I might be back if you follow the example of what Egosoft has done."

I have requested a refund, and would advise anyone else to not buy this game.Who knows maybe at Christmas when they have had some time to sort our performance and ideally have added in at least some of what was promised I would buy it on sale. I would still be hesitant, as the company really doesn't deserve any money for the stunt they pulled"

For a full price game I would think there would be much more from No Man's Sky. Factions, like pirates, trading guilds some sort of quest. there is a lot of room for improvement, what is the point of endless space if there's no drive to explore it.That said the game does look nice and I like the seemless travel from planet to planet. I'm giving it a thumb down, but I wish there was some middle ground like a a flat hand shaking. You know the game was  ehh . If I bought it on sale for 15 bucks I would have less buyers remorse and might like it more."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 14, 2016              No Man's Sky: Rating - 6/10Review contains minor spoilers you probably know about, nothing related to the ending though.TL;DR Edition:The game is great fun until you complete collecting Atlas Stones. After you complete that objective, it becomes tiresome just travelling to the center, which is extremely annoying to grind and will require you to go through over 100 black holes. While the game is extremely unique and the fun I experienced in the first 24 hours, it becomes repetitive. Buy it when it's Â£20 or less.Too Long; Still Going To Read Edition:This game offers an experience like nothing I've ever played before. Endlessly going to new planets and star systems has been one hell of a ride and journey for me. These planets really do have real variety to them, I've seen so many different mixes of terrain, as well as the species. The game really is something special and unique, but in a world so massive and randomly generated, how can Hello Games allow No Man's Sky to become repetitive for the user to play?No Man's Sky works off the idea that you need to get to the center of your galaxy. It doesn't tell you how to do it, it just gives you a ship and a multi-tool to work with and away you go. This idea is actually a great concept, it allows the player to come up with their own story, their own objectives and make decisions on what to prioritise doing. So you eventually fix up your ship and you are starting your journey. Now, at the beginning, you are asked if you would like the help of the Atlas, which will allow you to then join the Atlas Path and collect Atlas Stones, which are used later on in the game, which for me, was my main priority. So from that point on I spent 20 hours going planet to planet, system to system, learning as much about the species that inhabited these worlds, while also building up to my goal collecting Atlas Stones and I was loving it. But then I got all the Atlas Stones I needed and it was laid out for me, get to the center. This was it, the final objective, the last task this game had for me. I crafted warp cell after warp cell, going through countless black holes in a race to get there before anyone else could. But by the time I travelled through 15 of these black holes, I had only travelled a tiny 15,000 light years, with a frustrating 160,000 to go. This is my main problem with No Man's Sky and Hello Games. They expect you to be okay going through over 150 black holes to reach the center of the galaxy, they think it's an acceptable game element to have, when quite frankly all it does is drive players away from playing.This is where the repetition really hits in for you as a player. You just want to reach the center, you've done everything else, you've got a good ship, a large inventory and a great multi-tool, but that doesn't change the fact you need to grind all those warp cells to travel through 150+ black holes to reach a point you're starting to lose interest in. It kills me to slam this game because I've been enjoying my time with it so much and I love it, but this final act really does kick you in the teeth and is a disappointing end, to what is a great game.Conclusion:While Hello Games have crafted one of the most beautiful looking games I've played and how they've achieved what they've achieved with 15 people is astounding. But in turn, you've created a huge environment that makes the game feel so empty. This game needs more, give me tasks to do on the way to center of the galaxy, create new stones for different races, such as Gek Stones, just to keep us busy. This game is going to be updated and content will be added overtime, but I would strongly advise waiting until this game dips to around Â£20 before you pick it up. Â£40 is too steep for an asking price for what you get given in such a little time of play. While the game isn't a bad game, it just needs work. And with the right time and mindset, Hello Games can make No Man's Sky one of the most memorable games to ever grace the market.Edit:Game completely blows, with no updates, do not buy this crap, ggwp Hello Games."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 21, 2016              I'm afraid that, at least currently, I can't recommend No Man's Sky.It's very saddening to note that there's some very interesting procedural generation algorithms that make for interesting sights, be it in terms of landscape, ships, or more... but to me that's currently the only actually interesting aspect of the game.Even as a space exploration game, there just isn't enough to do. There's no drive to actually move forward, save for finding techs and improving your ship. Did I mention that the resources and language systems are a total ripoff from a mobile game, Out There ?There's also the launch fiasco: I've not followed the game prior to launch myself, but I was dead certain there was Multiplayer included. Turns out, it's something that the game's marketing won't admit openly, but as with most features that have been shown in what seems to be prerecorded scripted movies posing as gameplay, these features simply don't exist at all, or at least not currently. I didn't have anyone in particular to play it with, but it's still kind of a letdown...As some have mentionned in other reviews prior, NMS would no doubt have been one of the best games of the year if it hadn't been marketed like this, and instead been sold off as Early Access for 20$. But currently, I can't agree to support a company that almost openly lies and sells 60$ a game that they won't even admit is unfinished. Maybe if they did...I've been on the fence about getting this refunded, which would have been my first time ever on Steam.I choose not to ask for one, but I sure as hell hope Hello Games will manage to move forward, and maybe stop lying, both outright, and through bad marketing, to their fans and customerbase."

It looks really cool and who doesnt like the idea of flying through space in ships you can find, repair or buy ingame with money you earn from selling materials you can gather all over. NOW I NEVER checked any further into the info of the game as it was getting ready to come out. All I thought it would be was a single player adventure style game, so for me I wasnt one who got swallowed in the hype to be disappointed.If you love space, adventure, open world, gathering and crafting you will more than likely love this game. They have fixed it so there is multiplayer but it is just as fun in single player mode as well. This game has had quite a few large updates from when it first came out. I would say ignore all the negative reviews from where it first started because Im sure many who just gave it the one chance, then quit,  never came back to see how much father the creators have put into it.There are a few glitches or bugs that I have ran across while playing. One was when I landed on the side of a hill at an angle, and when I hop out of the ship, i glitch into a cavern underneath. Luckily if you have a multitool you can manipulate the terrain and get out. So make sure to have that thing handy and always refilled. Another was when I was playing with a friend. I joined his game and was on his large freighter. As I was leaving the cockpit to the landing area where the ships are parked, I fell through the ship (Like as if in ghost mode) and I died. Cant remember if I was able to get my stuff back or not cause if you do die in space, your grave will still be floating there. Small piece of advice, if you are playing multiplayer with friends and you are going to do a jump through space with a freighter, make sure everyone is in the cockpit with you. Not barely getting there and not in the hallway to that region. My friend selected to jump right as i was trying to get to the cockpit and I died in space.Also the game does seem a whole lot harder than it was in the beginning. My friend and I had to do several weeks of jumping to find a planet that was sort of close to an earth like planet. Its almost perfect but has storms that strip your health every 20 minutes if you cant get back in your ship or find a safe cavern. I remember when i first came into the game, finding perfect planets covered in lush green grass with no weather issues seemed to be pretty abundant. Now it feels like a 1% chance, or maybe the area where I was placed in the system is just doomed with dead and hazardous planets.I recommended this game to my older brother, now that it has been highly upgraded, and he has enjoyed it so far. He even got his daughter of 8 to play and she likes it alot. Again if you like space, adventure, and open world traveling you may really like this game. Whether single player or mulitplayer. There are missions you can or dont have to do. It's a very flexible a game"

Plus it was pretty heavily delayed. It's a fun 15$ game, but AAA price demands AAA content, and this is the mid-low tier of indie. I wish Hello Games would have been honest with it's customers.Pros:-I got a refund (took weeks, and a paypal dispute, but I got it)-It was really really cool for the first 4 hours.-Learning space languages could have been a little deeper (I expected proceedurally generated races, with similar languages) but was still really cool.Cons:-Only looks good if you don't look at anything closely (vanilla minecraft has better textures)-No multimonitor support (no HUD rescale options, just stretches). Sean indicated on multiple occassions EVEN ON RELEASE DAY that this would be a feature. -The default FOV is completely claustrophobia inducing. I imagine they force reduced it, so that your card is rendering less, and therefore  magical better performance , leads into:-Literal Aids optimization. I have a 1080 SC FTW and on ultra I got a whopping 70 fps. Mind you that was with frame drops/tears every 15 or seconds. I spent at least an hour trying to optimize.-Jesus â¥â¥â¥â¥ the spaghetti code. This game has more bugs than the Congo in it's peak of monsoon season. Hey, want to take off and move a mile or so forward to continue mining? WELL I HOPE YOU LIKE DEEP SPACE (when taking off, about 10% of the time you fly off planet; completely into space). Animals are often glitched: aquatic creatures stuck in air, spinning creatures, animals phasing through walls, teleporting animals, ect, ect, ect. I'm sure some of these bugs have/will be fixed, but these are too prevalent to be  missed  in the final touchups of the game (which was supposedly why it was delayed for over a month, not because they were being sued)-Lack of creature and resource diversity. The only resource that ever changes form is iron. Everything else is in basically the same form. I saw alot of LITERALLY IDENTICAL animals on different planets--most common were these little mushroom crab things that teleport along the ground. -There are literally thousands of posts talking about the missing features/promised mechanics, my big ones are as follows: animals don't interact with eachother. At all. Space combat is garbage, and has little reward (also where are my wingmen for hire????). Flying is bad (literally if its going to have 10 hours of exploration gameplay, at least give me controls to my own ship). If I want to ram my ship face first into a planet, I should be able to. On the subject of ships--there aren't different ship classes, at all, only  class  I can see is the individual a e s t h e t i c (which feels pretty Star Wars inspired). Multiplayer, where is it? If its not multiplayer, where are the advantages of singleplayer games (permadeath would be really cool).-Currency is so unbalanced its disgusting. I had the highest tier ship in my first 5 hours. -Puzzles that are one of 3 preformatted types, and zero difficulty. Please don't buy this game.Sean Murray, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you."

But while the game is in its current state full of bugs, lag, and overall just being repetitive, The game is absolutely worthless. Does it run well? Well for me yes, but others have reported it running like garbage. Please not while buying this game that there is so many better options for space games around the same money, Star citizen being one of them. I mean, come on Hello Games.

You can ocassionaly fight... Random ambushes or robots on the planet. You can't rely on combat to play the game.There is no economy to trade and resources are plentiful. Again, can't play the game soley based on trading.You can explore... On foot... Different planets with the same buildings. Flying planetside is extremely simplified that you can't even fly close to the surface of the planets.The game is not bad, just extremely shallow for $60. If you enjoy sight seeing randomly generated planets you're good to go. Dont expect indept flying or any kind of economy. Regret picking up this game."

I like shooters, I like survival games and I like space-ish games. I didn't jump on the hype train. I wasn't particularly looking forward to it but it peeked my intrest with the promise of exploration, survival, a little bit of shooting and some space combat and perhaps joining a faction. So I got the game, as it seemingly had everything I kind of enjoy. It's absolute garbage, at least, in it's present form. No, I haven't had any issues with performance, I've had a rock steady frame-rate. But I've found that activating certain items crashes the game so certain words are beyond my ability to learn.As for the game, well, it's repetitive and tedious beyond belief. Exploration is solely for the purpose of acquiring materials to keep yourself alive and to power your tools/taxi/ship. And boy do you need to power them a lot. Sure you can name stuff in world, but to be honest, after you name a few planets and animals/plants, you get to notice that doing this for months at a time, you start asking youself about the meaning of your life. The surival aspect really is boiled down to a simple concept. Power your suit with some stuff and to get that stuff get some other stuff to power your multi-tool.Combat on land, well, other than not wanting to talk about it, I don't know what to do. It's abysmal. Combat in space seems like it was tacked on in the very last second. You get scanned by pirates that come out of nowhere, they attack you, you shoot them down in between going through menus to power your shields.As for the general concept of the game, I feel it's best represented by the following instance. I mine a massive mound of pure gold on a planet (looks like a huge shinny yellow lump in the terrain) and move off to an other node. I turn around, look back and there is the same node I just mined. So I turn back to mine it and as I approach it, it fades away, only leaving a big deep hole in the ground. That pretty much sums up the gripes we have with the game at this point.Then add to that the fact that the devellopers outright lied about the game and seemingly removed portions of it. All in all, this doesn't add up to a pleasant product. Sure, there are some people to whom it appeals and I won't try to dissade them, but for me, the product felt incomplete, baddly thought out and poorly executed once I got over the initial period of awe."

Yes some planets can be quite beautiful and there can be some yaw dropping views.Even if some planets look like they are full of life and it sometimes even feels like an ecosystem, it is not. I constantly have the feeling that there is something missing. Im missing real civilizations, a real variety in plants and animals. Since they put almost every rescource on every planet and made everything so plentiful that there is no real challenge to it. I guess the reason is the age rating. I can't get away this thought that this is just an arcade version of the No Man's Sky we all have seen in the trailers and demos. My theory is that this was a profit maximization decision. If it was, then there might be a chance to get an advanced / sim version as free DLC. I'm 100% sure that they made it way more easy in every way they could, so they could reach a larger audience with the game. I'm not mad about their decision doing that, I'm mad about them promoting the game not beeing what it is right now. I was convinced after all those interviews and trailers that it would be way more complicated. I'm not sure if it was only me or if other people thought that No Man's Sky would be more like a survival space simulation with a complex periodic table (like it was advertised). More things to encounter and to discover secrets. I spend some good time digging underground, beneath portals, monoliths, etc. But what made me most sad was the poor designchoice about the alien races, including the Atlas.In the beginning it feels really interesting and those text based background story pieces you get from the monoliths and ruins are well written. After 15+ hours you realise that nothing you do in this universe will have an impact on anything. It just doesnt matter at all what your standing is with any of the alien races. And whats with those sentinels? Would be nice to know more about them. But I can't find any information about them.I could complain about so much more, since there are so many reddit post, youtube videos etc. about the flaws No Man's Sky has right now, I just skip that part.What makes the discomfort about the flaws even worse is the pricetag. I feel like I bought a Porsche without having the chance to really look at it. Then realising that I acctually bought a Smart :(Maybe you like the game for what it is right now, maybe you don't. The feeling I get now when thinking about the time I had with No Man's Sky is: acrimonious and lugubrious"

This is not what we paid for as a game. Especially for $60! It's completely unfair. Those lucky guys who were able to get the refund kiss your wallet. Cuz I doubt I'll prepurchase another game. And certainly never a game from Hello Games. Those god damn liars."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 17, 2016              Played ps4 version then sold it off to see if the pc version could be any better, in terms of graphics ,fov and options yes but the game still suffers from being a poor port and sometimes stutters on my dual TITAN X. The real reason I thumbed this game down is not because the game doesn't have a slew of options that was talked about but rather the game was paraded by sony as a TRIPLE A title when itis an early access/tech demo due to so much intense medicore gameplay elements. which is a true treason and a fine example of the Peter Polyneux effect. So ambitious to the point of not delivering up to it and many many of tthe features shown in past trailers or talked about is in the game at all, it is heart breaking for everyone..I would recommend this game for the casual/relaxed crowds or those that has never played survival/exploration games before and wants something really relaxing to play or those that never really followed the game for 2 years. Unless you like postcard simulator or can roleplay as a space photographer then this is a game for you otherwise wait for a price drop of what this game really is worth. I hope many people will learn from this hype experience and hopefully the game will update put in the missing features so that it deserves the ridiculous praise it gets from fanatics.Hopefully mods and updates to this game can make it better. Maybe My Video review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js93gEHmpQc Video of the hype and tthe lies and what the game really is promises made and broken  from Crowbathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=A8P2CZg3sJQ(P..S if you think this video is not real, you are lieing to yourself) Pros + The procedural Algorithim of the planets and creatures+The music+The weather effects+ Environments+ Mods on pc version to save gameI did not follow the game too much and these are my cons PLAYING the game. Afterwards I've seen the videos up top and realized how much material did not make it into the game at all. Wow Cons - Annoying button holding interface (Mod this out)- Repetitive mining and upgrading as the only gameplay element- Stale combat on ground and in space with really static AI- Very basic trade system and rep system that doesn't do much in galactic conflict- Lack of challenge to the game when you die. You can always repick up your body death location items and in space also. There will be pirates who are after your booty but they never actually take it... WTF?- Not a single planet is truly barren, they all have a building of some sort all 18 quantillan of them and so it loses the sense of being the first to explore the planet and loses its value in the sense of epic journey and exploration- Exploration ? What exploration? Every caves I have visited has a freakin dead end.- The procedural generated creatures are flawed, those majestic you see in the trailers might not be possible and this applies to planet also because once you see most of the biomes, the parts recycle itself way too much.- The ai is so lacking in this game it is incredible. Most of the creatures I've seen don't graze on grass or drink water or chase another species but they rather run around in circles. You can give them a treat and they will play with you but thats it- Your space ship is invincible, if you hit a space station head on you do not die, if you slam yourself into the planet you do not die, you can't drive your ship into the sun and die. Every damn ship feels exactly the same and  Only time you do die is when someone shoots you down.- out of 18 quantillian planets, you only encounter 3 sentient race in this entire damn game- No multiplayer of any kind and even if you upload creatures name it's just an online database. You cannot see each other in game at all even though this was something that was talked about during the entire process of this game with very vague mentions.- Tons of stuff missing that was talked about long ago.If you think I made all these up, Play the game for more than 40 hours and then tell me these aren't flaws to the game. I have seen 15 dollars games in early access with better gameplay.With all this factored in, this is not a triple A title but a rather overblown Indie title.Do you really want to see developers pulling  more stunt like this in the future?"

You can ocassionaly fight... Random ambushes or robots on the planet. You can't rely on combat to play the game.There is no economy to trade and resources are plentiful. Again, can't play the game soley based on trading.You can explore... On foot... Different planets with the same buildings. Flying planetside is extremely simplified that you can't even fly close to the surface of the planets.The game is not bad, just extremely shallow for $60. If you enjoy sight seeing randomly generated planets you're good to go. Dont expect indept flying or any kind of economy. Regret picking up this game."

But after the first hour or so it becomes a chore to play. I found it amazing that I could just look up at a planet and travel there and explore. But that's pretty much all there is to this game. You fly to one planet, sniff some plants, scan some animals then off to the next one. Some people like it, good for them. But, if you're like me, and were expecting something more from this game, than I don't recommend you buy it or atleast wait until it's heavily discounted. It pains me to say this, but No Man's Sky is just a glorified tech demo. What a shame... I'm glad I was able to get a refund as it wasn't anywhere near worth the $80AUD THAT I HAD TO PAY."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 19, 2016              Warning - some spoilers ahead.I had heaps of fun in the beginning, as the game starts out very promising; there is seemingly tons of things to look at and while you're doing the initial  get better gear  stuff it's pretty fun and visually pleasing.However..after a relatively short while, you start seeing a lot of repetitiveness.  Even though everything is procedurally generated, you begin to see a lot of very obvious patterns in the content, AI interactions and environment. It feels like the same few ideas and designs are just rehashed over and over. Tasks given to you become more like a chore than anything else.- The storyline is virtually non-existent, vague and pretty lacklustre (explore the galaxy at random, follow Atlas' path, or go to centre of galaxy)- NPC AI is extremely basic; same 3 races of aliens saying the same things over and over ad nauseam.- Spaceports are all identical inside and feel very basic, empty and barren.- Planets get very tedious after you've seen 10-15 of them.  The 4 different planet hazards (cold, hot, radioactive or toxic) have essentially identical effects, bar the name.- Most (if not all) planets have the same resources, so you can find pretty much all the basics you need on any planet.All in all, was fun for the first 20 hours, then really starts to feel shallow and unfinished.  I never followed the hype (literally discovered this game's existence about 6 weeks before launch) but feel that, given the little content currently present, it's definitely not worth spending $60 on.As a final note, the game is also very poorly optimised and ridden with really bad bugs, such as savegames not working, stuttering GFX, random FPS loss, CTDs etc.  The patching so far fixes one thing but seemingly breaks something else.  In essence, this game feels unfinished; great idea, great framework, but just not fleshed out."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 8, 2016              So here I am rewriting my review entirely. I didn't want to believe it at first, but I came to my senses afterwards. It is sad to say that everything said about this game was actually true. For someone who waited years for No Man's Sky to finally release, it is a huge disappointment & let-down. The developers falsely advertised the game, even using CGI screenshots on their store page. Hopefully other game developers will learn from these mistakes and I hope the new Steam policy will help.No Man's Sky has around 20 hours or less via gameplay - given you don't really stay in planets often or explore. Apparently reaching the center of the universe doesn't take long and it restarts the game after you have reached it. I'm not the one to be very salty, but the game wasn't thought through very well in terms of gameplay. Graphics are decent but could be a bit better. All planets are basically the same if you look at them - there might be a few different type of plants, AI, etc here and there, but ultimately nothing is super different.You spend most of your time grinding for a better ship and upgrades for yourself and your ship. That time spent grinding is basically the entirety of No Man's Sky. Combat is basic - that goes for space combat as well. You're better off selling valuable items you loot from plants on planets, basically being a trader first.There's quite a lot of micromanaging as well. If you're not recharging your life support or weapon, you're recharging all of your ship's needs. You spend most of your ingame time recharging everything. It wouldn't be so bad if plutonium wasn't so scarce on most planets. I found that plutonium is best found on moons.Survivability shouldn't exist since the resource you need to recharge your life support is everywhere. The only thing you have to worry about is your health whilst fighting with AI or storms.NPCs seem to be simple and a rinse & repeat on most stars you travel to. You have to discover new words of their language to understand what they are trying to tell you, most of the time you have to guess until you discover more words of that language.I wish I could find the enjoyment in NMS, but I can't. All the hype was for nothing. Hope you had a nice time reading this review! Below is an overall.OverallNo Man's Sky was nothing but a huge hype game and falsely advertised. Big disappointment but what can you do? Less than 20 hours of gameplay in it with major annoyances and rinse & repeat gameplay (grinding), no wonder this game became so negative. No Man's Sky isn't worth $59, it feels like a $9 game. If you want a better game that is worth its asking price, go play Star Citizen, Space Engineers & other similar/better titles out there.Rating: 2/10. I'm avoiding Hello Games in the future."

Why is it necessary to open the inventory and recharge the ship shields in the middle of a fight!?

(I can continue this list forever, considering the enormous hype that this game has). I can assure you that this game will contain those features (future DLCs, ehm, I mean, priced DLCs). The promise that the future DLCs would be free was also a lie.You can't fly close to the ground nor touch the water with your starship, the game crashes once in a while and you experience framerate drops frequently. The things above make me realize that the developers of this game haven't taken it seriously. I agree with people that say that you can enjoy this game, even with the missing features and bugs, but you can enjoy it only 5 hours before realizing that it's repetitive and boring.This game should cost no more than 20$. I won't recommend it to anyone.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"

Guardians will come but they drop equally good items/money. Sell it at the near spacestation. ~ 2-4 Million in 5 minutes. I haven't heard of a negative effect from attacking the  friendly  ships.Con:- Glitches of Spacecrafts, creatures and guardians. They can move through other textures/ships/landscape which will be annoying while in combat etc..- Planetary stations look the same all over the worlds- Grafics/Rendering while flying over the planets are .. crap: Trees  growing /moving out of the ground, colours and pixels are changing, pre-loaded forms are changing dramatically when you come closer. This contributes to a look of a really low-quality-grafic. Where are the options to alter the render-distance ?-  Animations /Camera-Movement/Loading of the Interface when interacting with consoles and aliens are too slow (i.e. each time you want to trade with another character you have to wait ~ 10 seconds before choosing an option). There is no possibility to cancel this ... Same for discovering planetary stations/spots.- Inventory of the ships are too small. Why is stacking items in ship not allowed ? Installed technology consumes mostly more than 50%. The upgrade options for the suit is better. My suit has a greater Inventory as my ship. I CAN CARRY MORE THAN MY SHIP! What?- No multiplayer- Even the  singleplayer -connection to the server is lost since a few days...- Finding  something helpful to my journey : Oh, I already have the technology...- There is no Map in the suit / for the planets. Are you looking for a place you already visited i.e. a planetary trade-station ? Good luck finding it. Your ship can only be found through the radar.- Finding all animals of a planet with the  scanner  is .. time consuming or not possible. Is there a option to upgrade the scanner to find/identify the creatures simplier ? I dont think so. Mostly there is one creature left which cannot be found. Very frustrating.- In the orbital and planetary trading stations you can meet up to 4 very SAME ships with the very SAME pilot at the very SAME time.- Very few options to modify (i.e. how about an option to tell the scanner what i am looking for: unknown creatures, specific ressource, artifacts, factory... maybe unlocked with all scanner-upgrades/technologies ?)- To get the  survival -Stars you need to survive on a planet with extrem conditions - for a really long time. If you change the planet, the  counter  will start again on zero. While longing again for the last unidentified creature on an extrem weather condition-planet I was 3 hours out there and I only received the 6th Star out of 10.- Guardias and creatures can attack you while you are in a conversation with an alien, an artifact or else. For a specific time (animations etc) you are not able to defend yourself or cancel the animation. Nice.- Price to high for the  content  and the developed state of the game. The list goes on..- Warning  Spoiler : At the end of the ATLAS Quest you are being asked to create a new Star (This will also end the game I heard). You need 10 Atlas-Stones which you received through the process. I sold them because of the highly restricted inventories. This is the worst.- Recent Development: After 1-2 Hours the game is going full retard with 1 frame per second. Everything else at my PC goes well. Don't know what's going on.- Only Safepoints are at the planetary/orbital spacestations/explorable objects and when leaving your ship. Travelling a lot will increase the risk that if the game crashes your last checkpoint is loooong ago. This time is wasted then."

I and many others were sorely disappointed by the release of the game, and I can see why many of the reviews are still very negative. But here's why I disagree with the negative reviews.What I see here isn't a trainwreck. It's not a dead-in-the-water game. Yes, it costs 60$, but that value is returned many times over. I see a development team hard at work making improvements to what was a poorly implemented start. Playing through the game now, again, I see so many improvements that were asked for by the community, implemented so that the game is constantly being made better. If you want a game that's perfect from the get-go, then No Man's Sky wasn't for you before. If you want a game that has been remade from a failed beginning, reforged into something fun to explore and discover, then I suggest you come back and take a second look.The devs of No Man's Sky have been listening. They have been toiling away. I'm sure they made enough money in the beginning to have closed the game down and possibly even retired, but instead they stand by their game. If this game were run by another company, we wouldn't see fixes and improvements like we are, we'd see DLC and cash grabs. Yes, the game is still expensive, but it funds the fact that the developers have not left us, and instead to this very day are working on making this game worth that initial cost. To me, it was worth every penny."

As an exercise in procedural world generation, it is fantastic. A universe of 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets, all procedurally generated by a bunch of math that all fits in a two gigabyte download is rather fantastic.What Drag's No Man's Sky DownThe user interface is terrible. Every time you change a setting or option, you have to restart the program. Every time you want to select a menu item, you have to hold a button and wait for a progress bar to fill up. That's right, want to click  confirm ? Simply clicking it isn't enough. Click and hold for a couple seconds, instead. It's clearly an interface designed for the console and a controller that was poorly ported.After you have visited three planets and a space station, you have essentially seen everything the game has to offer. They are all minor iterations on each other. There are only a few types of things to find on each planet, you'll start to see the same plants and animals (but a different color, perhaps) on every planet. Every planet will have generally the same resources (at least minimal necessities).The only gameplay element is really inventory management, which is poor. You can't even see what things you can craft unless you have a free spot to craft it in and you can't rearrange your inventory unless you have at least one free spot to use as a  middle man  as you move things about.The first couple of planets are exciting. Such variety! It's amazing! But by the third, you realize the trick.And then you start to realize even more of the flaws.Every planet has the same gravity.Every planet has plant and animal life on it.Every planet has minerals on it.Every planet has some  monoliths and stations on it where you collect essentially the same things.It isn't even that pretty. It's kind of grimy looking. And even on a powerful system, you get this obnoxious sort of grainy  pop-in  as you travel over a planet.And, ultimately, you shoot for the center of the galaxy . . . which is the end-game. And . . . well, if you really want to find out, just search youtube for the end. It's not worth it.This game is a brilliant concept and if this were Early Access, it would be worth a lot of hype. Unfortunately, it's a full triple-AAA priced published title. And . . . it's just lacking. Lacking in everything.The curiosity of this game would be worth $20 USD on sale at some point. As it stands now, it is difficult to recommend this game to anyone at full price. I may return to this game, someday, but only if they release a ton of additional content to it over the coming months.I like Sean Murray. He seems sincere. I'm sure that he had the best of intentions with this title and there are no doubt stories to be told of how influences from partners drove them to the state the game is in right now . . . but when it comes down to it, this is an issue of  is what I'm getting worth sixty bucks? .  At the moment, not really."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 2, 2018              I wanted to like this game. I really did.Iâm willing to ignore the controversy two years ago at release, where the developers (mainly Sean Murray) drastically overpromised and underdelivered in one of the most notoriously botched releases in gaming history. Iâm willing to believe that Hello Games marketing department suffered more from incompetence than malice. I didnât get burned by that (I didnât buy the game two years ago) so its easier for me to let bygones go bye. Fast forward to the NEXT update, which according to numerous online reviews, is now the complete game with all of the features promised in the original release. Pretty much everything that Sean Murray promised in his original media tour has been delivered with this new update. So I have to give them kudos for not taking the money and running. Unfortunately, even now that its completed, the game is still enormously unpolished, grindy, and the core mechanics feel more like work than fun.Be prepared to mine. A lot. And mining is SOOOO boring. Mining resources is basically hoping from one rock to the next and then holding down your mouse button. Thatâs it. That is all you do. You will be spending 60% of this game holding down a mouse button and watching a progress slider. The mind-numbing and utter grind that is mining is required for EVERYTHING and you really canât get around it. The other 40% of the game consists of base building, doing missions, dog fighting, exploring the planets for one of the 5 points of interest there is to find, and trading. Ohâ¦.and you can also mine in space, which is equally as boring.Base building is a bit strange, given that this is a game that is set around exploration. The base building mechanics are basic enough and easy to get the hang of, but cost a lot of resources, which you get from mining. Be prepared to spend about 3 times as much time gathering resources as you do actually constructing your base. And once you finally have your base the way you like it, after hours of committed time, be prepared to have your base disappear in the blink of an eye because of a cosmic reset or a bug (there are LOTS of bugs).There is a mechanic that lets you own a freighter and build a fleet of frigates. You can then send your frigates out on expeditions. This sounds like it should be fun, but Hello Games has worked very hard to make sure this system is not without is share of tedium. Sending out expeditions basically involves pressing a button and then waiting several hours. That's it. And before you can do this you have to mine (yay! More mining) for fuel. There really isnât much more to it than this.Dog fighting is reasonably fun, but it is also fleeting and extremely basic. It is almost impossible for a mouse and keyboard, so get yourself a controller. You can trade. This, as you might expect, involves buying resources at one system and selling them at another. There are limited options and trade resources, so this can get tedious VERY quickly. You also canât escape the mine-and-grind with this option either, since you will need to mine for fuel.I wonât comment on multiplayer, because it doesnât appear to be finished yet. At least I hope its not finished yet. The only experience Iâve had are other random players joining my game, blowing up my ship, destroying my base costing me hours of time, and then logging immediately back out. Fun stuff, if youâre a griefer.With the NEXT update, the game now includes all the promised features, but the fun-to-work ratio is still WAY off. You will spend about 3 hours grinding for every 1 hour of fun you have. I'm guessing most people will be about 10-15 hours into the game before they figure this out on their own. If you are the type of person who enjoys mindless grinding, then you may enjoy this. I mean it when I say âmindless grindingâ. This is one of the most boring grinding mechanics I have seen of any game ever, and you will be doing a lot of it.If you are insisting on buying this game, then get it on sale. It isnât even remotely close to being worth the full asking price. Don't get me wrong. There is a fun game locked somewhere under all of the tedium. Hello Games still has a lot of work to do if they want to get the balance right. Until that time, I can't give my reccomendation."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 27, 2016              I honestly did not follow this game very closely through it's development cycle, though I had heard things and knew how much people were looking forward to the game.I initially bought the game seeing that one of my good buddies was playing. I wanted a game that we could play - but I wasn't super attached to the idea of multiplayer. The idea of a game we could play separately but still talk about our different paths, planets, etc. was also appealing to me.It was fun for the first... maybe 6 hours or so. I upgraded my ship, my multi-tool, and learned an alien language. After that, I just didn't feel any reason to keep on doing anything in the game. Nothing actually seemed that it lead anywhere and there was no real sense of progression outside of getting a bigger inventory so that I could farm more to get a bigger inventory.I came in with mildly high hopes, and left feeling very very disappointed.EDIT: After 2 years and lots of patches (Which I give them props for sticking with), this game is now closer to a level that it should have released at. I still don't find it very fun. I think the hopefully-not-temporary $30 price tag is much more fair, and might be worth a shot at that price if you like Space-sims - but it's still not a game I like very much."

Not to say that the game is bad, I do see a ton of potential in this platform for a super-expansive world to play in, but this game and grind felt flat after a while.Here was my experience:It took me a while to get the first 3-4 atlas stones, but after that I was power warping from getting my 4th all the way through my 10th... Fine whatever the grind was getting old as it was. Ok, what now? I am going to head to the center of the galaxy. Cool! Blackhole! I am 179,000 lightyears away, let us do this... Game: You've traveled 54,000 light years! I look at the distance left and I am 177,000 lightyears away from the center still... Ugghh, ok, I find another blackhole along the path.... Booom 100,000 + lightyears traveled... You guessed it... only a few thousand closer. I think I made it to about 173,000k after 3 or 4 black hole visits. Not to mention something breaks  when you go through the holes, forcing you to land and gring and grind and grind until you get bored of that planet, head out, get attacked by space pirates, kill all of them, fix your warp drive upgrade just to do it all over again, and again, and again and again............."

Please be open minded about NMS and try to ignore the bad launch it had. I hope you might consider buying it after reading this review.  I know i dont have that many hours in-game, but i feel like i have played it enough to write this review.  Review: Yes the game was a huge flop, at release. I can't say anything to that.Yes it was missing nearly every feature promised by Sean Murray.The planets was really repetitive, and so was the creatures.There were going to be huge space battles, were you could join either side. But none were to see.And really the most disappointing one: Multiplayer. We all had the dream of flying around with our friends, exploring strange new planets and solar systems. This of course did not happend either.Many more things could be mentioned, but then this review will probably end up too long.But now just a little more than a year after release date, Hello Games have really made this game into what they promised.. Well nearly. Positives  - We now have tons of variations from planet to planet. Many different creatures, some surprisingly scary.  - Graphics has been improved greatly. If the game weren't stunning you at release, im sure it will now.   - We can build bases, and set up various sectors for different opperations.     - Vehicles can be crafted, and are very useful for gathering resources or visiting outpost and so on.     - Owning a freighter is an option. And there are also crashed freighters scattered around planets, that can be looted.      - Multiplayer arrived in August this year  (2017) . In this case the word  Multiplayer means that up to 16 players can explore the universe together. So not really the fully scaled multiplayer, we all were hoping for at release.        - Terraforming was also added to the game in August, this tool can be used to carve into the landscape of the planet of you're choice. Negatives  - The game can still be a little repitive, especially at start.  - We cant land on asteroids yet, but why would you anyways.   - There are no ringed planets yet, although this can easily be fixed with a mod  Ringed Planets Mod [www.nexusmods.com]    - Some major glitches are in the game, it has occured that ive multiple times gotten stuck underneath the planets surface. This can be pretty demotivating since i had to kill my self to get free I hope that you see that NMS has become a much more detailed and fun game, than it was at launch. And i hope you might consider buying it after reading this review.I would recommend this game to anyone who like exploring alien worlds. For anyone who might enjoy action, the space  fights can get very intense.My rating is 8/10."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 31, 2018              I've been watching this game since its horrible launch in hopes of eventually seeing improvements, and getting it. Until fairly recently, friends pics/vids didn't do anything to draw me in further, and reach for my wallet.So now after the last two updates (NEXT, and especially the Abyss), and seeing positive feedback from the more informed, and mature players, along with some stunning pics/vids, I've decided to take the plunge.The game reminds me of ARK in many ways, yet different, and I've enjoyed that one a lot. You're plunged in the middle of a harsh environment, and have to search for basic needs, ingredients, and crafting to make it through the first day. When you start catching on to the games mechanics, and procedures, it does get easier.Finding ingredients, and crafting may seem hard, and/or cumbersome to some, but I approached it much in the same way as I did with ARK. Once you get your ship fixed up, things get a little better. The problem is  Getting it fixed.  Find this, craft that, and then repair.For the most part, you can do as you please in this game. The Open World Exploration/Survival, is its key assets, and attracted me the most. The tutorial is pretty good, if you read it. Most of my questions were answered there, and the in-game guide. The graphics, and music is very well done. The story (if you call it that) can be done at your leisure, and you will certainly immerse yourself into the game.Some could find this game boring, repetitive, and tedious, and it can be at times, but it also has many plus sides to it, if you take the time to look. I can now recommend this wonderful game, and expect to have many hours of fun with it.The best guide that helped me in early game (or anytime) is this one:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1451250092ðð¼ ððµððªðð¼ ,ðð®ð®ð¹ ðð· ððªð¶ð²ð·ð° !âð±ð"

        "Comments": "Posted: September 26, 2016              No Man's Sky is full of promise but fails to deliver on most of it. In fact, its grand finale all but rubs the user's face in the fact that it lacks any sort of cohesiveness.You can discover the entirety of No Man's Sky's game play experience in the first ten minutes of play; land on a planet, collect blueprints to enhance your gear, collect the necessary resources to build those plans; build a warp cell to fuel your warp drive, and jump to another star system. That's it, that is all there is to discover. The hook is in doing that across myriad planets so that you can reach the galatic core and learn what 'The Atlas' has placed there. Unfortunately your reward for repeating that short gameplay loop practically countless times is, quite literally, nothing. You are given the chance to do it all over again. The game implies you are to do it again in a different galaxy, but make no mistake, you will see the same style of planets, enounter the same styles of flora and fauna, meet the same types of aliens, and gather the same resources to enhance the same gear.Now, there's nothing wrong with an open-ended space simulation. People have gravitated towards those types of games for decades. The most notable example being the Elite series of games. The problem with No Man's Sky is that it has no where near the depth of economic simulation nor sense of 'being' that a game like Elite has. Outside of gather resources, build items, and travel, there is nothing you can do as a player. You can't haul cargo. You can't partake in piracy, you can't plan your own destiny. You're locked into a mindless grind for no reward.Marrying the genres of  Space simulation  and  Resource/Survival   may have seemed like a great idea. It was certainly portrayed by Hello Games as a great idea. Unfortunately many of the idea of the space simulation genre were talked about, but never implemented in No Man's Sky. The resulting game is repetative, boring, and ultimately insulting.There are better resource and survival games to play. There are better space simulation games to play. Spend your money wisely, don't spend it on No Man's Sky."

The entire drive to keep going seems to be trying to get additional inventory slots so that your inventory doesn't fill up so quickly so you can continue to get more inventory slots."

And No Mans Sky still isn't beyond that in my understanding. Yes I like the additional content, Hello Games added since release, but there is still a long long way to go to get this Game to its GoldStatus, which strangely was announced half a year ago... Ups..Compared to similarr (EarlyAcces) Titles like  SpaceEngineers  and  The Astroneer  for example, I've to say that those simply offer a lot more content for a lot less money.. A fair and transparent marketing campaign included.And if you want to play a well crafted SpaceSim with a vast Universe and PlanetaryLanding, please take a closer look at Elite Dangerous! :)No Mans Sky still has a long way to go, to reach the center of the universe.."

It seems reaching the center of the galaxi is even worse. I stopped resisting and read a rather unveiling review. Seriously?! I am not going to tolerate this in all honesty cruel game engine, savegame mechanics and other eyebrow raising issues considering what this is supposed to head towards and the ammount (lack) of effort invested in this joke of a story-line. One of the most mixed experiences in game land since a considerable time. The price is absolutely not justified. Not recommened. After 76 hours of exploring, mining, upgrading, etc. there needs to be at least a bit more of a reason to keep me going another 100+ hours before I reach the center to then just be ... !!??"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 29, 2016              Well I really tried to enjoy this game for what it is. When I pre ordered this game I had thought that the game would be like it was portrayed in the videos and images released by hello games. After I got to about three hours of game play I realised that I had made a grave mistake. I quickly tried to return this game and see if I could get my money back to possible spend it on a more polished and more finished game. As many other people have said, this game should have come out early, for less money as an early access game, that would have at least given people a basis to judge if they would actually want to purchase an unfinished and broken game that was would disappoint more than half of the people who bought it. By far the best thing about this game so far is the fact that people on the Internet seem to be as disappointed as I am.Hello games lied time and time again about what would be included in the game, as well as showing footage that included features were not implemented in the game and that may never be. When I read that valve started to give some people refunds, I was happy to hear that at least some people would be able to get money back out of this unfinished game that had too much to live up to. My advice to anyone looking to buy this game is, if you do want to buy this game do it for much less than full price, it's not worth $60. If you look online, there are many videos showing how the developers, more specifically Sean Murray, lied about what would be possible or included in the game. If you are still considering buying the game then look on YouTube and see for yourself if you want to explore not so interesting planets and do repetitive tasks just to have to do it all again.If you actually got to this part of the review then, thanks and if you agree then don't get the game."

In case you are actually looking for a review, I'll add yet another one to the virtual sea of excrement that comprises No Man's Sky.  If it wasn't for the laughable price of admission ($60), I'd have thought this game was an acceptable addition to my gaming collection.  Seriously, the concept of deep space exploration, coupled with procedurally generated landscapes/creatures warrants a playthrough.  It is possible to immerse yourself into the world, albeit for a short time. This is No Man's Sky's most inherent, inescapable flaw - its depth.  What originally presents itself as a massive and grandiose exploration/crafting game, very quickly devolves into a lackluster, agonizingly shallow stroll through mechanically identical environments.There is no depth here. nothing to aim for, nothing to grind for.  There are no underlying mechanics to enhance or differentiate anyone's experience.  Sure, you have ship and suit upgrades, but these upgrades, it seems, only really allow you to stroll faster through the environments.The novelty of exploration isn't enough to keep you immersed, or remotely satistfied with the moment to moment experience.Steam shows just under 10 hours of playtime - that time was split up between my spouse and I.  We both walked away bored and dissapointed.  $60 worth of dissapointment.If you can pick this game up for around $5, that should arouse enough of an experience to justify the price tag, but a full $60?  I'm sorry but the content doesn't merit a full price tag.I went in to No Man's Sky looking for a space exploration/simulator that was large and varied, but also simple, lacking the overburdening complexity of other (much better) space simulators.  Ultimately it was far too simple, relegated to a space walking simulator.Wait for a HUGE discount, if you are still curious."

The trailers and footage shown by Hello Games and Sean Murray look and play nothing like what we have here. Even as someone who has put hundreds of hours into games that some might consider boring or dull like Elite: Dangerous and Eve Online I cannot recommend buying this at full price. Maybe in a few months enough will be added to the game to make it a worth picking up but as it stands wait for this game to get heavily discounted on a steam sale."

For those reviewers that says this is a very niche catergory, im sorry to say even as a exploration game is not worth 60 bucks at all, i played 17 hours and i have not seen anything that is similar to the trailer. A few points to note before buying this game..-No large scale space battles.-No giant dinosaur like creatures on land or in the sea.-Cockpit of the ships i have gotten my hands on doesn't look as detailed.-Don't seemed to be able to pick the landing spot i desire like in the trailer.-Space game without gas giants and planets with rings..

Yes, it is huge and does mostly what is advertised.  The problem is that it becomes pretty repetitive and frustratingly awkward at times.  I now know before I land at a site what I will likely encounter - no surprises any more.  The sameness of the experiences is a major let down.  Waiting for the slow panning of the camera and slow text boxes to appear to slowly tell me what I have already figured out using context clues becomes maddening.  This game really is a mining simulator.  The only driving force in the game is to mine resources to fuel your equipment to allow you to...mine resources.  Learning the language doesn't seem to matter, as each encounter is very similar and you can figure out what needs done without any language.  Different ships do not behave differently, only look different and hold more/less than what your other ship did.  At least if I could use my resources to make some paint and fix the ugly color scheme of my ship, that would be something to look forward to.  This feels too much like reporting for work, and not enough fun or true sense of adventure.  For example, every planet is already named and has outposts on it - why bother making it seem like I'm a star bound explorer finding things first?  They obviously have already been found and settled at some point.  While my planets have been very different (on the suface) from each other, spending a bit of time on them reveals the truth - they are all basically the same experience, just colored differently and making you mine different resources to stay alive so you can keep mining resources.  At least if the gravity were different, it would make it kind of fun.  If some big, new, free gameplay enhancements don't arrive for this game, stay away.  I truly wanted to love it, but am now bored and frustrated that I spent so much money on the preorderEdit - I continue to play this game for some reason - perhaps that is the underlying secret of NMS?  I was just sure if I explored a little more I would find someting amazing or wonderous, but haven't yet.  I have walked all over this damn planet looking for the last missing species to identify and cannot locate it, and I need antimatter because I traded my ship for a busted ship for something fun to do, and now I can't warp to a new system.

No way to map, set notes, or meet other people. The lead developer is a lying sack of â¥â¥â¥â¥ con-man and I hope someone clones his game and add everything he promised and then sells it as their own."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 21, 2016              This game was long awaited by a lot of us. It was supposed to be one of the best games this year but everyone can see that it falls short of our expectations. We hyped up the game to an impossible degree and disappointment was sure to happen but no one expected this. The game is barren and seems unfinished. This could have been a great game had they worked on it more. I don't know if it's deadlines, fundings, stress, or all of the above but it's not worth buying at this point.It's really sad to see yet another indie game flop but I will hold on to a little bit of hope that they will improve the game and reduce the price over the next few months/years. I got a refund and recommend everyone else who got the game on release to do the same before it's to late. We should all wait it out and see where it goes. I think that is the best option. They could fix this game if they added more depth. I wish this would have worked out. I just hope Hello Games takes this as a learning experience and not a giving up point."

However, once bought, this game exposes itself to be the boring, grinding, repetitive, down-graded lie that it is. The gameplay shown in the trailers is all made just for the trailers and actual graphics are not even close to what is shown. This game has potential, but what was promsied is not what was delivered, and is certainly not worth $60."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 31, 2016              Anyone reading this review is probably just surfing terrible reviews, looking for a good chuckle.  In case you are actually looking for a review, I'll add yet another one to the virtual sea of excrement that comprises No Man's Sky.  If it wasn't for the laughable price of admission ($60), I'd have thought this game was an acceptable addition to my gaming collection.  Seriously, the concept of deep space exploration, coupled with procedurally generated landscapes/creatures warrants a playthrough.  It is possible to immerse yourself into the world, albeit for a short time. This is No Man's Sky's most inherent, inescapable flaw - its depth.  What originally presents itself as a massive and grandiose exploration/crafting game, very quickly devolves into a lackluster, agonizingly shallow stroll through mechanically identical environments.There is no depth here. nothing to aim for, nothing to grind for.  There are no underlying mechanics to enhance or differentiate anyone's experience.  Sure, you have ship and suit upgrades, but these upgrades, it seems, only really allow you to stroll faster through the environments.The novelty of exploration isn't enough to keep you immersed, or remotely satistfied with the moment to moment experience.Steam shows just under 10 hours of playtime - that time was split up between my spouse and I.  We both walked away bored and dissapointed.  $60 worth of dissapointment.If you can pick this game up for around $5, that should arouse enough of an experience to justify the price tag, but a full $60?  I'm sorry but the content doesn't merit a full price tag.I went in to No Man's Sky looking for a space exploration/simulator that was large and varied, but also simple, lacking the overburdening complexity of other (much better) space simulators.  Ultimately it was far too simple, relegated to a space walking simulator.Wait for a HUGE discount, if you are still curious."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 11, 2016              Well, I've never written a Steam review before but this game has made me come out and give up my tuppence's worth. You have to understand this game and the illusion it weaves before deciding to buy it. The game sells you the idea of an endless galaxy/universe populated with an almost limitless number of fully-explorable planets. You aim is to reach the centre of the galaxy and discover what lies there. This sounds fantastic but it is a con. This is a procedurally-generated sandbox of infinitly repeating assets shambled about in a vague simulation of a galaxy. What you actually get is a system populated by a small number of planets re-utilising the same assets over and over again.There is no real sense of a galaxy in any stellar sense. All of the planets are essentially the same but with slightly different variables in terms of landmass, colour palette, radiation and environmental factors. You will always find bases and mining resources and beacons and so on within a minute's flying time. All the same. Endlessly repeated. There is no galaxy scale model with nebulae or black spaces or spiral arms, etc. You are always basically 'jumping' into the same simulated solar system.As for game-play, forget it. If you enjoy mining to upgrade to mine better to upgrade better - and then start all over again ad infitum then  you may enjoy this - otherwise, stay clear.This is a demo for what a procedurally-generated game can do. No more. It is layered over with a slightly existential narrative which proports to lure you into questions of creation and exploration - but that too is nothing but a con designed to distract you from the essentail hollowness of the playing experience.Do not buy but wait until it is on a LOW sale - and then pick it up as an oddity. Nothing more."

It is big vast exploration game with many many planets and galaxies. But. When each planet you visit contains same recources as 20+ you have just visited, it gets boring really fast. As extra, any screenshot or cool moments in trailers you see are here just for advertising. Most of it isnÂ´t real.If you donÂ´t mind tedious farming, seeing only 3 alien races in vast amount of planets, pretty short storyline and hoping to discover something no one has discovered yet, from quintillion planets, then this game is meant just for You.So why i still play this game from time to time? Well, I still hope to find something different, something extraordinary, even tho i know this is like finding needle in the haystack."

I really did try to like this game, but just got so boring and tedious. I am a completionist, I wanted to find all the creatures and whatnot, but found myself just not caring at all and leaving planets right after touchdown because it all looked the same. So sad. I do not recommend anyone buying this game."

However after that the game is boring. Repetative. Dull. Featureless. You find yourself jumping to a new system. Looking around a planet exploring as you see new lifeforms which begin to look all the same after a few systems. Exploring various points of interest such as outposts, monoliths, trade centres etc which are all identical to each other across all systems. All the stations are the same on the inside. You can barely understand what the aliens are saying, and they give you the same puzzles to solve...ultimately, the game has no depth to it and quickly grows old. I do not recommend buying this game, spend the Â£40 on something else more worth it. Like paint."

NMS' trailer did show things that weren't possible in the game, like flying close to the ground. The planets are not unique, in the sense that each one is just a different color, with what essentially are the same plants, the same rocks, the same stalag-tites/-mites yielding the same resource. Every planet is guaranteed to harbor the resource that you're looking for. Each planet has a couple bases or crashes, usually containing one alien (or less; none). It doesn't give me the sense of wonder that I'd get with other exploration games, a sense of depth and true accomplishment. I like to follow a story, but NMS' lacking plot just didn't do it for me. Subnautica fits in the same category - survival exploration. But it has a plot, true excitement, it's beautiful, and it doesn't hand out false promises. This wasn't meant to be a review about SN, my point was simply to be that SN's incomplete, smaller, yet so much more fulfilling. I wish NMS' ratings could be as large as its universe, but not this time around. Truly a shame, this could've gone somewhere amazing.Edit: Just a note here. Since I couldn't get a refund, I decided to try and make it more  fun.  I'd rather not let it gather dust. In case you like to mod, there are a few mods out on Nexus Mods that add some depth to NMS. Mostly visual, but it made my experience better overall and I recommend it. Increasing the variety of animals/plants, removing the chromatic aberration, increasing the size of a few plants and rocks on each planet. http://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/searchresults/?"

I've kept myself updated on the current state of the game via various youtubers, and with the release of  Next , I thought I would give it another try, since a lot of the reviews stated that it finally delivers on the promises made two years ago.But it is still bugged as f**k. I tried to start a fresh game, it crashed during the  loading shaders -screen.... I tried another time and it crashed after 15 minutes... Seriously, after years of development and another two years of patching, I can't defend, or recommend this game to anyone... it is a fine example of what is going wrong in the gaming industry in 2018... half finished products, bugged to a state I could only define as unplayable as someone who likes to sink more than 15 minutes at a time into a game...I stated in my last review that I would check NMS out, if the quality gets extremely better... I did that now, after two years... Although, as stated in the beginning, I can see that a lot of hard work was done here, the product is still unfinished and bugged... This time, I won't come back, I am done with this game, and hello games as a developer. This is a waste of your time and money"

You might even consider it a piece of art and I do confess that I am mildly intrigued by its background story.On the 'game' front, however, I think it doesn't do so well. The few gameplay elements there are (resource collection, crafting, combat on foot, combat in space, navigation) all have a kind of first-prototype feel to them. A bland, just-enough-to-qualify level of craftmanship.This is the state that I would expect in an initial early access release. I think there is a lot of potential, but almost all areas of the game need a lot of iteration.There are also some things that I really don't like about No Man's Sky.  Alt+Tab crashes about 80% of the time  the UI is unintuitive and cumbersome to work with  extravagant and glacially slow UI animations constantly waste your time."

In case you are actually looking for a review, I'll add yet another one to the virtual sea of excrement that comprises No Man's Sky.  If it wasn't for the laughable price of admission ($60), I'd have thought this game was an acceptable addition to my gaming collection.  Seriously, the concept of deep space exploration, coupled with procedurally generated landscapes/creatures warrants a playthrough.  It is possible to immerse yourself into the world, albeit for a short time. This is No Man's Sky's most inherent, inescapable flaw - its depth.  What originally presents itself as a massive and grandiose exploration/crafting game, very quickly devolves into a lackluster, agonizingly shallow stroll through mechanically identical environments.There is no depth here. nothing to aim for, nothing to grind for.  There are no underlying mechanics to enhance or differentiate anyone's experience.  Sure, you have ship and suit upgrades, but these upgrades, it seems, only really allow you to stroll faster through the environments.The novelty of exploration isn't enough to keep you immersed, or remotely satistfied with the moment to moment experience.Steam shows just under 10 hours of playtime - that time was split up between my spouse and I.  We both walked away bored and dissapointed.  $60 worth of dissapointment.If you can pick this game up for around $5, that should arouse enough of an experience to justify the price tag, but a full $60?  I'm sorry but the content doesn't merit a full price tag.I went in to No Man's Sky looking for a space exploration/simulator that was large and varied, but also simple, lacking the overburdening complexity of other (much better) space simulators.  Ultimately it was far too simple, relegated to a space walking simulator.Wait for a HUGE discount, if you are still curious."

The trailers and screenshots Hello Games teased show vibrant landscapes with interesting creatures. I gave this game as much of a chance as I could and played it for 19 hours, but never came across anything nearly as interesting as all of the trailers. I got repetitive, dull environments with little difference between the worlds. Also, this is VERY important, the game is falsely advertised on the store page as being compatible with an i3 processor. My computer has an i7, quad core, 2.6 GHz, 8 GB RAM, and can barely run the game at 20 frames per second. My average framerate is 18 frames per second on the LOWEST graphics settings, and I even have a GTX 950m card in my laptop as well. I bought the game on release, but the reason I waited so long is to see if the developer would update their game and fix it. It turns out they did not, and I can still barely run the game. If I can run Max Payne 3 on ultra with 60 frames per second, how could I possibly not run this game?"

It was supposed to be one of the best games this year but everyone can see that it falls short of our expectations. We hyped up the game to an impossible degree and disappointment was sure to happen but no one expected this. The game is barren and seems unfinished. This could have been a great game had they worked on it more. I don't know if it's deadlines, fundings, stress, or all of the above but it's not worth buying at this point.It's really sad to see yet another indie game flop but I will hold on to a little bit of hope that they will improve the game and reduce the price over the next few months/years. I got a refund and recommend everyone else who got the game on release to do the same before it's to late. We should all wait it out and see where it goes. I think that is the best option. They could fix this game if they added more depth. I wish this would have worked out. I just hope Hello Games takes this as a learning experience and not a giving up point."

However, once bought, this game exposes itself to be the boring, grinding, repetitive, down-graded lie that it is. The gameplay shown in the trailers is all made just for the trailers and actual graphics are not even close to what is shown. This game has potential, but what was promsied is not what was delivered, and is certainly not worth $60."

As it stands Hello Games has tarnished their reputation by going silent in the face of overwhelming criticism from the public regarding the lack of many features which were shown in promotional footage or even spoken about by the  great  Sean Murray himself during his exhaustive press tours leading up to the release. I would like to believe that Hello Games, and Sean Murray will make good on thier original promises by way of extensive patching, however based on thier complete lack of community interaction post launch I simply cannot imagine this happening.

However after that the game is boring. Repetative. Dull. Featureless. You find yourself jumping to a new system. Looking around a planet exploring as you see new lifeforms which begin to look all the same after a few systems. Exploring various points of interest such as outposts, monoliths, trade centres etc which are all identical to each other across all systems. All the stations are the same on the inside. You can barely understand what the aliens are saying, and they give you the same puzzles to solve...ultimately, the game has no depth to it and quickly grows old. I do not recommend buying this game, spend the Â£40 on something else more worth it. Like paint."

Witch deserves a prase since it has been 2 years since release. Each update has improved the game up until this point. A big update is coming aswell, I suggest picking it up / giving it another try after that. I know i will after update. Cheers!"

I loved the graphics, had no trouble with start-up or anything of the like, and just felt like it would be fun to play for hours on end.However.... I was salty about the multiplayer not being there. I read about there being ''classes'' with different types of ships and different kind of roles you could fulfill (trader, explorer, etc.) but that's not in the game.You can choose sides with the factions? Gone, can't tell ships apart and there is no customization or way to differentiate between different ship styles and function. Simply because there is none... The only thing that changes is the visual aspect and the amount of slots in the ship....I could go on and on about letdowns that this game has produced. But I did thoroughly enjoy it at first. But for 60 bucks? Not a chance, it feels rushed and not finished, broken even to some. 18 trillion planets, but you'll get tired of repetitious foliage and fauna in a few solar systems time, only the horns are different for example.I'd give it a 6/10 because the game itself was fun for a while. But I'll give it a 5/10 because the price and promises are a total letdown to a game that has a good foundation, they should have worked on this a few more years."

I eventually gave up after about 100 hours because it just wasnt what I wanted.Advance time by one year and here we are. With their latest huge update, they showed me that they do care about the state of the game and they brought it much closer to what I once believed this game would be judging by the videos and screenshots of E3.I had to mod this game to actually enjoy it previously, now?Most of the mods I used are implemented into the game and I don't even think I really want to mod the game anymore other than maybe reshade.You can now:-call your ship to you-teleport to your freighter-farming-building-terraforming(you were able to destroy, but now you can create)-vehicles-more quests and factions-more variety-muchhhhhh better graphics-30hr story expansion-Multiplayer(sorta like a beta but it works!)Honestly I can go on, but I really just wanna go play..!! With the special its on, if you were ever hesitant about this purchase, do it. You'll immerse yourself into a grand sandbox universe. HG really pulled it off. Late, but they did it. Give them a chance, I don't think you'll be dissapointed, not as much as release anyways.Keep it up team, you have my vote."

Hope they get it sorted[EDIT 1] they seem to have identified the problem I'm having as something to do with my processor not supporting SSE4.1; although my chip is way over the minimum spec there's still no fix.[EDIT 2] Running the experimental version and now it crashes to desktop after the title sequence.[EDIT 3] 3rd day of release and still nothing from devs about the unstable experimental version.[Final Edit] Finally got sorted and I got to work playing, it was great for around 6 hours, beyond which you'll soon realise its the same thing over and over and over again. NMS fails to deliver on a great deal of what we were promised. This game is a huge dissapointment to me, but serves as good lesson: Never pre-order anything again[update] I'm still furious about not getting a refund for this mis sold garbage{update 2018} After a few years of development the game is no longer absolute plop, its merely not worth $60. I reckon a permenant $30 price would make the game worth it and would get my reccomendation"

Last Hour: FINALLY HERE! HI LAST ATLAS!.... Oh. i need 10 atlas stones. I have 9 because i lost one when my ship got distroyed. Well now what? Maybe i can buy one.......... OH i can! For.....6 million units. Ok i just dont care. I think im done now. So yea. That was my entire expierence. At first it was so exciting and i didnt really care what everone was saying but nearing the end of the game i really started to notice what everyone was saying. For $66 thats alot of money to pay for something that gets really boring and something i truly feel like i wont be playing again for a long time. If i replayed it now it would feel like everything was repeting."

Where is the depth? Why does it feel like the most exciting thing in the game is managing my inventory?Hopefully Hello Games will reconsider their post-release change of mind about no paid DLC, not that we have much to worry about considering their lack meaningful updates since release. No Man's Sky was advertised a fantastic wonder but was released as a genuine dud."

But for 75AUD I can not recommend it. It's simply not worth that much. Screenshots and trailer also don't represent the game at all. Please look for in game footage on YouTube before you buy, it's nothing like advertised. At least see what you're paying for before you make up your mind. As for what we have, it kinda ended up like Spore, great in theory but execution has holes. Looking forward to updates, hopefully we'll see that E3 quality down the track."

I think this is a fair comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYNriatnYkE2. Procedurally generated world in this game is like white noise â random, but all the same. It gets boring after a few planets.3. THERE'S NO GAME! I mean, there is a huge procedurally generated world, some game mechanics but they don't form a game. There's nothing really to do except farm resources flying from one planet to another, but these resource aren't really needed for pretty much anything.I didn't know much about the game when I bought it. The videos looked kinds cool but turned out that they were all false. The game looks nothing like them! After some more research I found out that the game was supposed to be totally different (http://www.onemanslie.info/the-original-reddit-post/) but most of the features didn't get into the game.I spent 36+ hours farming resources hoping it would get better eventually... but it didn't. I wish I used refund at the beginning."

Prior to Hello Games popping their heads out of the sand with update 1.1, this would be a negative review with a few swear words, a bundle of anger and a lot of disappointment (as the majority of reviews have already).Sean Murray did boast a ton of features than didn't exist and that were the main reason for people buying this game. I am not condoning his actions nor has he been forgiven but, this update to the game is a promising sign for the future of the game.The 1.1 update includes base building which is surprisingly extensive and includes features as (base building, obviously) hiring aliens to work in your base, a teleporting feature so you can store your valuables and return to your base via space stations, two new game modes, survival (which has a major difficulty increase) and creative (like mine craft where you can create anything, craft anything and have infinite health ect). There are other improvements which you can view in the patch notes (I haven't explored the update that much yet).Before this update, it was a huge thumbs down and I would recommend anyone avoid No Man's Sky like hot Sh|t but now, I'd say, keep your eye on the progress of this game and maybe look at getting it in the future if Hello Games keep their promise of fixing this mess."

The game is way better, and I feel that people could/should give it another go. It still has its moments where you get an odd bug (kind of like any bethesda game lol), but nothing that going back to another save can't fix. New things I noticed:1. New ship and multi tool stuff.   -There are classes of ships now, with some innate bonuses for things. Like say ship agility, weapon power, so on. (A, B,    C, and others.)2. Scanning changes. You can now scan planets from space and see like 4-5 different planet specific mineral things that planet has. Like say gold, nickel or copper.3. Freighters to haul more stuff. Also you can keep up to 6 vessels (5 and the one you're currently using). So now you can have one for killing space pirates, one for mining, one for hauling your planet trip stuff so on.4. New questlines. I started over on a new save slot because I wanted to see the game over since I came back from a long break. Worth it! If you do come back I would recommend starting over because I don't know if it will be buggy from an old old save.5. 3 new groups to earn reputation/interact with. These are not races, but guilds who hand out generic missions and help with the storyline. Mercenaries, Merchants, and Explorers are the groups. 6. The menus have changed some, but not enough to be a bad thing... It is an improvement I feel from what I remember from release. I will edit and add more as I feel as necessary as I discover more. I hope I was helpful."

The idea of having a universe which is procedurally generated and full of strange worlds to explore really excited me which is why I felt so let down after 15 hours or so of gameplay. I even kept it going for twice that time, hoping that things would get better but they don't. We were promised all sorts of great stuff such as factions to join in order to feel like you were taking part in the universe but it's more like you're just passing through it. The aliens you meet are extremely boring and repetative, leaving the universe feeling empty and dry. The ships look nice to start with but they don't have any variation at all in terms of how they feel to fly in.The overall objective of the game was built up to be this amazing journey to the centre of the galaxy but in actuality, all you do is wander around for hours grinding for materials to build irrelevant upgrades for your suit, weapon and ship or wander from place to place to salvage ships in order to increase your inventory size. You pay Â£40 to grind resources to upgrade your inventory size so that you can grind more resources!Granted the feel of the universe is great and it does have the feeling of enormity but this is certainly not enough to make the experience enjoyable and is certainly not worth the asking price. I hope Sean Murray does keep his word (LOL!) and release future DLC to make the game more exciting but given his track record on keeping promises, I wouldn't hold your breath."

They've improved some of the performance bugs, but there are still issues with it crashing on PC.Just some general complains:- All ships are the same. Sure they look different but outside of storage you don't gain anything.- Factions are pointless- UI is garbage- Each solar system is static (planets don't rotate around the sun, moons don't rotate around the planets- Almost all resources are available on all planets, trading seems pointless.- So far most of the planets I've seen have a very similar structure.- There is no point to checking different parts of any single planet, the entire planet is exactly the same all over.- Flying is just terrible. There is an invisible wall preventing you from flying to close to the surface of a planet. It's basically auto pilot, which makes it fun trying to land on a pad that you can't see.I'd say it's worth $20 but wouldn't recommend spending more on it unless they add a good amount of content/features."

It is genuinely impressive that the only loading screens are whne you first start up the game and when you go to a new galaxy. You can fly in space, fly to a planet, land on the planet, get out of your ship, get back in, take off, leave the planet's atmosphere, and back into space, all with NO loading screens!"

        "Comments": "Posted: October 3, 2017              What a rollercoaster this game is.I pre-ordered, and felt absolutely cheated when the initial release came. We've all read the news stories and seen the enraged posts online -- the lying, the deceptive claims, the huge tracts of missing content. Many developers would have taken a hit like that and sunk their game in the deepest hole they could find.Instead, the devs spent a year making update after update, all free, slowly struggling to live up to the grandiose claims they'd made in the first place. It's still not as ideal as actually releasing the game as promised in the first place, but now, finally, No Man's Sky feels something like an actual game. With some faint glimmers of story and worldbuilding wrapped around the gorgeous procedural galaxies, it's able to hold itself together -- if only just.It's still not worth the full price, but I would eagerly suggest grabbing it on sale. It's beautiful, the music is lovely, the takeoff-to-orbit flight has zero loading screens, and every update has improved the game. There's not much story or ultimate goal to speak of, but it's not about rescuing a space princess. It's just about seeing what's out there. And now, at last, the answer is  something .EDIT:TL;DR / Summary -- They lied and called an Early Access game a polished blockbuster, but after tons of updates and two DLC Expansion sized upgrades, the game is juuuuust about worth buying on sale, if only for some truly beautiful procedural vistas."

THAT IS IT. everything else is nothing special when coupled with all the false advertising and lack of any driving reason to play.and to boot: there were too many people requesting refunds, so steam stopped accepting them. or mayby i just didn't get a sympathetic employee reviewing the two refund attempts and the support case i opened. what a shame that steam wont protect its customers from obvious bait and switch marketing like the kind the developers used to push this title."

I have a top spec system and the lag/frame rate is still a problem. Promo videos showed worlds with active wildlife and rivers etc, the wildlife runs around and either attacks you or doesn't... that's it. Very one dimensional. Even flying around feels clunky. Explore huge worlds at snails pace, everything is too slow. Not enough upgrades or crafting, no meaningful interaction with factions just one random battle after the next."

No Man's lie... It's all wrong so let's see if I can cover it well enough.The world:The galaxy is beautiful and expansive, different colors and shades everywhere, very flashy, but it's all the same, there's only so much procedural generation can grab from before things look the same, and No Man's sky hits that barrier very quickly.The gameplay:It's so repetitive it's not even funny, you can get more variation out of a game of chessThe aliens:There are three differen races: The beaked Gek traders, the cybernetic Korvax and the warrior Vy'Keen... That's it, in the however many trillion planets we get three species spread between them, the wildlife isn't even worth mentioning because after ten planets it'll all look the same.The lies:Sean Murray said the game would be multiplayer, then quickly said that we would never find eachother because the universe is so massive. Immediately two streamers met up in the same location and couldn't see eachother, zip nada nothing. People have tested the network traffic against games like Elite: Dangerous and No Man's sky has very little network traffic, nowhere near enough to facilitate actual multiplayer. Players were lied to time and time again and for $60 dollars that is unacceptable.On top of that Sean also said there would never be any paid DLC for No Man's sky, well guess what? Paid DLC is coming out...The verdict:Screw this game and screw Sean Murray, the blatant lie this game is isn't worth your $60, go find something else and forget this game exists."

Normally I can decide if I like a game or not quickly but this game I had to give a fair shake. I had years of buildup and it took till the final moment for me to decide to purchase and actually try this game. Two hours wouldn't suffice, there were difficulties from the beginning and the game starts off slow and so I tried to give it a fair shake, ending with 44hours of playtime.I went in with many expectations. Their old video clips left me expecting a lot, various wildlife, a bit of mystery and the joy of exploring a universe in a sandbox mode. This game... failed on many counts. First it touts so many worlds yet everything is simply reused. Even beyond wildlife, the flora on each planet was exactly the same, to a point where I was surprised to scan flora and find out it was something new despite being identical to something I'd seen minutes before on another planet lightyears away. Wildlife never actually changed either, I continued to play listening to the words from the creator of how the universe changed the deeper you went, yet nothing changed. An arm or leg might be different but looking for creatures that were vastly different or exotic simply never happened.There is also a bit of an open ended quest ingame, however the quest.. is beyond unfufilling, it seemed like something worse then busy work for a reward that was simply text and then being pointed to the center of the universe, again.Graphically there were also many problems. First the fild of view was terrible, even set at max I'm unsure if there was any change, and this was part of the reason why I never went with the PS4 version. I followed guides to extend beyond the normal setting but then doing actions can show errors and you can see how higher fov was never really intended and perhaps the slider is simply supposed to act as a placebo.There is also the popin issue, which was beyond terrible. I understand why it happens but the fact is that its terrible and shouldn't exist to an extent such as this.I even found some a gate in game which clearly had been intended for one reason yet was never fully implemented, leaving me with another bit of an unfinished game I simply had to ignore and leave behind.I honestly could complain more but after so many hours.. I feel like Ive wasted quite a bit of my life for something that felt rushed and unfulfilling. The creator hasn't communicated and honestly, it's too late for me to feel better with any words so long after the fact. I cannot recommend this game at it's current price, it's honestly not even a game and a longer review would be needed to get into other complaints. I feel I have tried my best to find good points and.. they are all so small so as to not make a dent in all the complaints I still have. If one is interested in this game, I'd suggest waiting for a massive sale, waiting for updates or simply looking at other games. This is early access at best, being touted as a full game."

This game as it stands is pitiful. I wouldn't have paid $10 for it. Heck, right now I am unlikely to keep playing it for free (it was a gift). Unfortunately, it took about 7 hours to figure out it wasn't going to get better, the tools weren't going to improve, there wasn't a story to uncover, there was no crafting depth around the corner, and the overall lack of features wasn't just a beginning stage hindrance of a hundreds hour sandbox. Basically it's a Spore knock-off with less features, and a touch of nagging simulator tossed in. Clumsy multi-menu reloading and obnoxious inventory management is where the fun is according to these devs, kids. And, hey, if you thought navigation should be a priority for a space game, you're asking for way too much. An easy way to go back to places you've already discovered? Geez. What kind of entitled gamer are you.Even the procedural development gimmick all the hype was based on doesn't really deliver. For all the claims of infinite diversity, most things look pretty similar. So I missed the refund window. Who knows maybe it'll be fine and the devs will accidentally make a game out of this mess . Or maybe they'll just run off giggling that a bunch of idiots believed their empty claims while moving on to their next scam. For $60, you can find out, too!"

Finding random droppods out on the planets that i need to pay game currency to increase my inventory? What are they even doing there?I really feel cheated. At this point, now that the hype is non existant, they already have my money. Basicially a money grab / Con that I fell for so shame on me.If you dont mind micro managing a tiny inventory every 7 seconds when your ship, mining lazer, lifesupport and thermal protection runs out of fuel, then this game is for you.If you like travelling the stars, by yourself, for no reason other than scanning cut and paste critters, plants, rocks, and sending them into the  cloud  of 18 quitillion stars so that someone else you dont know, likely wont even find, then this game is also for you.The only thing I found appealing about this game is the ability to buy new ships. But really, in order to do that, I need to spend hours farming big blobs of metals (and constant farming to refill my mining lazer and ship for my multiple take offs and lands) only to fly them to a space station to sell and wait until a random NPC alien with a ship that looks neat decides to stop by.Sigh, you managed to take everything about this game and turn it into a repetitive grind. Yes I only have 20 hours on record, BUT SERIOUSLY??? If the game isnt good after 20 hours, it aint good."

After this games entire infamous history, it still sits at $60.  I'm replaying it, this time on DXM instead of alcohal and its pretty awsome. Is it $60 dollars awsome?  Not really.  This games history of dishonesty was biblical. The good will of hello games is very commendable, but the entire hustle is unforgetable. $60? The publisher has some stones.I do like the game alot, but try and get it with out handing your money to the suits and ties. Its a $30 value. Try gettiong it for less. [For anyone who doesnt know, this game is being made as we speak.  It's a lump of clay and from its early stage I cant say what will come out the other side.  It looks to be promising. Minecraft in space is the kind of cosmic crack I can keep coming back too and the potential that I see leaves me hopeful. Dont let anyone tell you that this game is NOT early access.  I guess Sony, Hello Games and Steam forgot to pass that message on.  This is textbook EARLY ACCESS.]"

In this case No Man's Sky was shown to have traditing game mechanics with NPCs, Quest lines and story driven campaign, graphical fidelity and game play features such as camping and managing a settlement that are not present in the finished game that I bought and to be honest this makes me rather sad.-Secondly, when it comes to the actual game performance it isn't trully well optimised which in this day and age I am just tired of repeating. From my computer to people with high end and recent machines this is a let down for me and a huge red flag as I went out the way to build a decent computer in my budget and get good overclocks too.-Thirdly, this will be my final point in this game. I think the technology and algorithimns that went into the creation of No Man's Sky though not truly used correctly (according to patent theft laws), the game truly makes me wonder about the future of procedurally generated games and this is a big and bold step towards that future. It's an experience but one can I just sadly cannot recommend. I'm sorry about that."

I continued hoping to find anything more redeeming, but came up empty.  There is nothing in the way of difficulty.  The only thing valuable are inventory slots.There is no meaning or purpose in playing this other than to appreciate the vistas.  None of the ships' or creatures' appearance has anything to do with their stats.  You have no meaningful purpose.You might get some nice screenshots for your desktop wallpaper though!"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 21, 2016              After putting some time into No Man's Sky, all it's been is a dissapointment. Many would tell you it's the hype that killed the game, they'd be wrong. It's the fact that many amazing features promised over the course of it's development cycle are missing or have even been scrapped from the game. The mysticism and beauty of the planets shown in the promotional material is completely void within the game. Every planet is a simple rock, and I'm sorry but I feel no want to explore something as barren and bland as a rock. Yes, I understand that not all planets should be Earth-like. But that doesn't mean 99% of them should be barren. What happened to the cool sand planets and hopefully different types of planets we were promised? I want to fight giant sand worms, fly with giant space whales over crazy and interesting rock formations. But sadly the planets here don't provide that. Space battles and factions be damned if the game just had actually interesting planets to explore. But sadly that just isn't the case. And even if that were the case, you'd most likely be spending most of your time managing your inventory and trying to figure out how to best manuever the UI instead of taking in the sights. And the RPG elements? Don't even bother, your choices don't matter. Apperantly after making a stupid decision because I couldn't understand one of the aliens. I was forced to marry one of their kind. I thought  Holyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ what's going to happen.  The answer? Nothing, nothing â¥â¥â¥â¥ing happened. That alien never showed up and never will, showing me that all the decisions are nothing but a simple way of figuring out whether you get a reward or you don't. Then I decided to try some piracy, if I couldn't have fun being the good peaceful guy, why not try to be a villian for once. Nope, the combat is so bad not only was I shot down in seconds, but I could barely maneuver my ship correctly to even get shots off on the enemy. Then I had to frolic through the terrible UI and Inventory system trying to repair my shields only to find that I died because it's a stupid idea to have it so that to recharge your shields YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR DAMN INVENTORY! Don't buy this game, wait a few months. Hopefully then those features promised to us will be in the game and I can actually do the exploring and adventuring that I've always wanted to do in a SCI-FI universe. I cannot and will not recommend the game in it's current state. Wait, just wait. All we can hope for now is that the game's cut content will be given to us in free updates instead of being forced into payed DLC. IF it becomes payed DLC, then this game will forever be a dead galaxy filled with barren rocks, and static cardboard pieces that are the aliens and animals. If you've read this far, thanks. If you don't want to read, then I'll sum up my post with this. You can only go towards the horizon, there's no way to take a dive and see what's underneath it all."

The only thing valuable are inventory slots.There is no meaning or purpose in playing this other than to appreciate the vistas.  None of the ships' or creatures' appearance has anything to do with their stats.  You have no meaningful purpose.You might get some nice screenshots for your desktop wallpaper though!"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 28, 2016              No Manâs Sky will be remembered as one of the biggest disappointments of the year, possibly of the decade. This has only been cemented by the fact that Steam has made an exception to the refund policy to allow people to get their money back on this game - I had bought it weeks ago and had 12 hours of playtime, and I thankfully got my money back after being initially declined.Ever since the E3 2014 trailer captured my eye and the IGN first looks painted a picture of an amazing next-gen space game, I was extremely excited for this game. I was still having decent fun with Minecraft at the time, and though itâs now lost its luster after almost 7 years, it still had a great run as a game to play with friends. It spawned this entire genre, and even today it holds up if you and your buds have nothing better to do. Regardless, I wanted something more, and I was expecting that next big leap in the survival-crafting genre in No Manâs Sky. One that could rise above a genre marred with mediocrity; broken, unfinished games full of empty promises and vanished Kickstarter dollars. Somehow, I thought that an indie studio backed by a massive publisher (Sony), with all the resources and raw manpower they could provide, could overcome any challenges they had and deliver the game they had promised. That didnât happen. I could sit here all day and talk about the grinding, the bugs, crashes, and performance issues, the godawful inventory system, all of the content being copy-pasted assets literally millions of times (killing this game as an exploration sim), and so on. But at this point, there honestly isnât a whole lot to say that hasnât already been said. Iâll try. Some defend the game, saying that people got way too overhyped and the game couldnât possibly have met everyoneâs expectations. Thereâs an element of truth of this. I counter, though, with  this post: a massive list of everything that was promised in the gameâs trailers, the IGN first looks, developer interviews, statements, etc. about what the game would and wouldnât be. However, none of this is present in the final game. People were sold on a game that they didnât receive. Honestly, this is borderline class-action lawsuit levels of deceptive advertising, and this is probably why Steam is allowing refunds so leniently now.The only thing I really disagree with on many of the reviews Iâve seen is that they say itâs âmediocreâ, âaverageâ, and so on. No. Itâs a straight up bad game, with almost no redeeming qualities. The game feels like a tech demo instead of a fully realized game. The only ones who are still playing this game are simply in denial about how bad it is, and denial is the first stage of grief. Remember, people got REALLY excited for this game - the devs received death threats when they pushed back the date, after all. Theyâve been so hung up on it for so long that it would deal devastating blows to their psyche if they came to terms with the fact that itâs bad. Give them time. Theyâll come around. The player base, which started in the 200k range on launch, has now dwindled to around 7 thousand at the time of writing this review, a testament to how underwhelmed most are.This has all been really sad for me. Search up Angry Joeâs review of No Manâs Sky - he really captures the excitement and passion this game stirred in millions of people, and the sheer force of a massive letdown. I was definitely one of those hyped people - not to the point of sending death threats or being blind to what was right in front of my face on launch, but extremely excited. I was looking forward to playing this game all summer, and I was hoping it would at least hold me over through my senior year. It didnât even get me through a weekend.For those disaffected who are still looking for a decent space game, give Starbound a look. It may have been marred by a complicated development cycle, but the end product is a game that is everything No Manâs Sky tries to be, and more - for only 15 dollars. And, it has multiplayer, so you canâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥around with your friends. Other than that, though, it looks like all eggs are in the basket for Star Citizen to truly deliver the next-gen space experience millions of us are looking for. I completely understand all skepticism that surrounds that game - especially since No Guy Buy will cause people to be suspicious of games for years to come. However, these devs actually seem to know what theyâre doing and how to communicate with the world at large, unlike the crypticism of Hello Games. Iâm not familiar with Chris Roberts, but from what Iâve heard, he has a pedigree of making great games. Thereâs also literally thousands of hours of in-game footage, developer interviews and discussions, a playable alpha, and almost daily updates on their website. The gamescom demo some time ago shows that massive progress has been made. Of course, wait and see. I, however, will remain cautiously optimistic for SCâs future."

While I do recommend this game because I feel as though, at least a part of it, can pique interest in any sci fi fan, I do not believe it is worth the $60 right now, maybe 29.99 or 19.99, but there is simply not enough content to be worth this much money.How is there not enough content in this endless universe? It has an upgrade, mine, repeat loop that will keep you interested for a little while but without things like base building, full multiplayer support, more customization options, avatars, etc, it is simply not enough to warrant the price tag, essentially everyone paid $60 to see what a truly endless universe looks like in a game as early as possible, and honestly it is something amazing to go through, but it just needs more, and who knows if it will ever get it."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 10, 2018              This is another example with the problem with steam reviews. Biased reviews can make or break a game. Over hype for this game became a double edged sword. Now it's a hype thing to be negative about this game.Recent reviews continue to say 'they come back and play a couple of hours to see how the updates are'. The problem with that is there is much more depth and changes to the game that a couple of hours doesn't allow you to see what this game can now offer. I want to try to stay objective as possible while waiting to see what they do with this game.Overall my review message is to not pay heed to the bad review ratio on steam. Most of these reviews are biased and butt hurt over getting their overblown expectations crushed. A lot of these reviews haven't changed since the horrible launch. If you're on the fence whether to come back to NMS or try it after the fallout, look for recent gameplay videos from trusted content creators. See why they still play the game and see for yourself.Summary of changes since launch:-Planets are more varied (less dead rocks in space)-Base building/ terra forming-Hire npc's for your bases-More vehicles to unlock-Better creature variation-Exploration and creature discovery is actually rewarded now-Farm building-More ship variations and types with stats-Ship combat is better (needs a bit more depth imo)-Pirates and bounties -More crashed ships to loot (could use more depth)-More npc types and traders-Buy and customize a freighter ship-Inter-system trading makes sense now and has more depth-Invite people to your base or visit other player's bases-You can see up to 16 players in game in an area as orbs (not much but it's a start for multiplayer)-There are questing hubs now-There's a 30 hour story arc-There are more quality of life changes (eg. better upgrades, teleport between bases and freighter, 'stargate' monoliths work!)-Different game modes (creative, survival/hardcore and normal)-Graphics are improved / optimisation is improved-Overall progession has more depth-Third party Mods can add a lot and allow you to customize your experienceLet me put it this way, NMS now has more content and life than Ark: Survival Evolved (a game so empty and still unfinished it can only survive on multiplayer for content). I can recommend you to buy this game but wait for a sale or wait and see what NEXT has to offer. For how bad it started, it can only get better. I will continue to watch this game and update this review. So far all updates have been and will likely continue to be free. At least there's that, oh and no freaking loot boxes."

Discovering anomalies. After approx. five hours it's all about grinding or just  no significant and repetitive  exploration. The places looks almost the same. Every space station is the same. I can't name my ship. To get into center of the galaxy took me additional 15 hours with fully advanced spaceship after hours of gathering resources and gathering money thanks to selling  bypass chips .There is no economical model. There is also no need to learn language of other aliens, because there is nothing more than exploration.I feel ashamed by developers which are NOT RESPONDING. Not answering. Not even bother to make this better. They are just sitting and patching the game up - this isn't a way how to release a game. Trust me. We released our own game on Steam. It's easy to communicate in truth. But no, Hello Games taken the radio silence way.The center of the galaxy? Don't bother. Without any spoiler: There's nothing.Absolutely nothing.At first I really trusted the game and Hello Games there is something more hidden. That If I will really invest more time - it's not just about jumping from planet to planet. Because I was at E3 SONY Press Conference 2015 and I want THAT build - not this piece of unfinished game for 60â¬.I feel robbed.But at the same time I am glad I had a chance play prototype of the great game in their CORE. Don't get me wrong. I am mad about poor game-design choices which creates so much frustration even for advertised EXPLORATION. Game-Design which feels like prototype of something which is not defined yet.Now I guarantee that some else developer/studio will grab this whole idea, make it in smaller scale and go with it as soon as they can to Early Access for 20â¬ and it will be 100% success. Nobody will remember No Man's Sky. And that's a shame. I want to see what Hello Games will do about it. And one more thing, if this will someone from Hello Games read, let me give you one little advice as developer to developer:  COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR COMMUNITY , for god sake, hire at least someone who will answer on EVERY related question.For example:  So can we see each other in the game or not?  (of course we can't, but it could be great to read/hear it from you directly)I guess I don't have a right to ask steam for my first ever refund. Since I've played more than 27 hours. Take my money then and go away."

But in the end that's all this game really is...amazing potential.The first 10-20 hours will be magical: a new planet flourishing with seemingly unique plant life and animals, resources to gather, a spaceship, once fixed, will be your portal to explore the vast cosmos. Look up in the sky and see other planets and possibly even moons that you can actually fly to and claim discovery like Christopher Columbus. It all seems like a fantasy come true.Then reality strikes...The front page of the No Man's Sky Steam store showcases some blatant lies.For example, the page says  In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again. That is a flat lie.After about hour 20 where you should have a few hyper space jumps under your belt and have explored each planet and moon in the systems where you have visited, you come to the realization that the places and creatures you discover have some extreme likenesses, and in fact are exactly the same places and creatures that you have visited on previous planets.The same plants, the same animals, the same buildings, the same life forms, the same space stations, the same ships, the same weather patterns, the same sentinels. It's ALL the same.Everything is a clone of everything else, just on an immensely vast scale. At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. This statement isn't even worth dissecting. It is just not true. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit. Death doesn't come at a cost; you simply respawn and go to your grave to get your stuff back. Unless you consider choosing not to recharge your life support as a choice for survival, there are really no choices to make that affect your survival. Trade convoys travel between stars No. Factions vie for territory No.Mind you, I've taken these statements directly from the No Man's Sky Steam store page. I have not edited them in any shape, form, or fashion. They are just flat lies.Then there was the promises by Sean Murray in his many videos about the features that this game would offer. Blatant lies and false promises. Certainly stretching the truth at a minimum. Stephen Colbert was even genuinely amazed and excited.And then there's that multiplayer thing....that isn't quite multiplayer. More like an online catalog.The final nail in the coffin of this terrific alpha build is its instability and crashes. No finished game should ever crash this much. EVER. And it's not even one game breaking bug. There are literally dozens of game breaking bugs. Nearly every action in the game has been tied to a crash. Hello Games has no respect for quality assurance. They've hyped up the product feeding on the hopes and dreams of anyone willing to drink the koolaid. Unfortunately they've laced that koolaid with cyanide...No Man's Sky is ultimately a product launch failure, but it might be the most profitable failure of all time. Outside of the excessive crashing, I enjoyed the first 20ish hours. But boasting 18 quintillion planets, I expected a lot more variety and uniqueness that would continually keep the exploration and discovery aspects fresh and exciting. Instead the game hits a point where it feels empty, mundane, and downright boring."

Anyways all the other negative reviews are true; this gmae has poor optimization, it is grindy, there is no multiplayer (as promised), no kinetic physical destruction from giant animals or bombs on vegitation/planets. No man sky has a great base for a game but its not there. I hope in time there will be some serious changes made and i can change this review, but i doubt that will happen."

It's not.Also no end to the game, no matter what path you take, so don't try.Would be OK if:- $30 less- didn't take 5 seconds just to open trade with each person (and for no real benefit)- could do anything in the marketing videos- quest rewards weren't useless after an hour of game playI didn't need an end, but felt like it did have one so it made you try :`(And please stop making grind games and calling them the next Minecraft.EDIT: CAUTION - playing a few planets before realising that you've just wasted your time will put you over the Steam refund 2 hour limit! Cheers Valve....EDIT EDIT: Have a look through the other reviews on steam; one thing this game gave us all is some good laughs. You know when you are all sad, so as a group you laugh together.

This is worth between 10 - 20 euro, depending how you feel about basic survival games. Better yet, get something else.Foundation Update: After this update No Man's Sky starts to resemble the industry standard for the survival games. Still there is not much to do and new gameplay options do not really bring much to the table. Perhaps with future updates it will get better."

Most of what made this game sound exciting got feture cut, and the fact that it takes more than 2 hours to find out the rest of the game lacks all these things Sean Murray talked about months before the game launched, but not when the game launched... Its incredulous. For $60, I feel amazingly ripped off.The game isn't without value. Its still technically a game. I would have been ok with the game being 80% of what was shown at E3, etc. No Man Sky is at about 40%, and you can't even find that out until its too late."

In the trailers, there planets that varied in climate based on their distance to their star. There were desert planets near the stars. In one of the trailers, an enormous wormlike creature slithered along the surface of a desert planet. In the trailers, you could fly as close to the surface of a planet as you wanted. There were enormous crashed freighters on the surfaces of planets. We were told there would be planetary physics, in atmosphere combat, and, most importantly of all, multiplayer. Sean Murray tried to get people to never realize that multiplayer is absent by constantly stating that it's there, but you have almost no chance of finding someone. People 'found' each other on the first day that the game released, but they couldn't even see each other. I tried to like this game, but it got repetitive far too quickly. I kept playing thinking that there would be a great reward at the center of the galaxy, but after a friend reached the center and I learned of what happened there (which, by the way, is EXTREMELY disappointing) I couldn't bring myself to play anymore. It became a chore. This game is in no way worth $60. This was one of the most disappointing purchases that I've made in my entire life."

Check their social media posts and you will see nothing that addresses the issues such as why we were told time and time again that the game was multiplayer but the chances of seeing someone was slim, yet people have gone to the same planet in the same system and even stood on the same spot and cannot see each other.Furthermore it was said that when you discovered one of it's many creatures you could name them and that name would stay indefinately. That's rubbish, the names are wiped. The UI seen in the videos on the store page is not what the game shows you either. It's all faked.So don't do what I did and buy yourself this for your birthday and then feel let down because you fell for the lies and b/s. Wait for a more deserving game to come out and then come see what other steam users think of it."

However, I've always had a different take on it.It's more like going to a restaurant that advertised the best steak in the city. Only, in this resturant, you pay upfront. You order their  famous  advertised steak, only to get something that looks like it came out of a TV dinner box. You eat a piece of it, trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. After all, they said it was the best selling steak and everyone in the city bought one. As your chewing it, you can start to tell, it clearly isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either. You tell the waiter, let him know that this steak isn't as amazing as advertised, and maybe he mixed up your order. He assures you the kitchen will fix it, and will bring you a new steak. Now, you're sitting in this restaurant, starving, waiting for the  best steak in the city , while the steak you ordered sits in front of you, getting cold. You wait and wait, and hours go by. Your waiter said he'd be right back, with a new steak, but that was hours ago, and it seems like the restaurant cleared out. You're still starving, so you continue to begrudging eat the steak you were served. It's far from the best steak, it doesn't even taste good at this point. But, it's the steak you were served, and you're hungry. You look around and ask for the staff, but no one is there. What can you do? At what point can you go look for the waiter? How long is too long to wait for what was  promised ? You already bought the steak, and you're hungry. Do you leave the steak behind entirely and find a new restaurant? Do you keep eating, just so you can feel full, as if you got your moneys worth? Do you demand a refunded? This steak is clearly not what they advertised. How do you even go about doing that? It almost seems like the entire staff disappeared. The longer you wait for the waiter that doesn't show up, the more frustrated you get with the mediocre steak you received.Other restaurants you've been to have had their faults too. But their waiters always seem to come back. They tell you things like  sorry, the kitchen messed up  or  your food will be ready in 10 minutes . They sometimes will even let you sample a dish you aren't sure about. This is the first time you've felt neglected at a restaurant. Sure, maybe you are feeling entitled, needing to know every detail about your meal. But compared to other restaurants, when they make it seem so easy, you can't help but feel like you've been cheated."

This game is such a huge disappointment, allow me to list some of the reasons why:-At $60, you expect a completed and fully developed game. GTA V, for example, would fit this bill.  NMS is clearly no where close to be a compelted title, and lacks any sort of depth that one would come to expect in gamess made after 1990.  -There's no multiplayer, contrary to what was stated by Hello games.-There's no depth to the game. It's all grinding materials to upgrade your ship, grinding for materials to sell to buy a larger ship, and grinding for materials to power the engine, so that you can grind for materials. Ugh.-The 'procedurally generated worlds are all most identical, with the exception of the color palets. There's probably 5-6 actual unique planet types, and the rest of the variation is in color. -The animals look like Spore rejects.-I purchased Subnautica, a greenlight title, for $14.99, and have been extremely happy with it. It's far more complete than NMS, looks better.I'm so disappointed how the NMS release went down, and Steam's lack of refund. For the love of god, don't buy this game. It might be worth torrenting to see how bad it really is, but only if you have unlimted data, not worth it otherwise."

Now it is like that E3 experiences that was promised to us with even more awesome new features such as the 16 players multiplayers, the ringed planets, the brand new unlimited base building and much more! If you weren't already a fan, reach for the stars and get on board with this new updates and the following weekly updates!"

Unfortunately what they have made is a game that has only about 1/3 of the features promised that runs like crap on your pc.  After many hours of going to the next planet to find something interesting I have quit playing this game.  There is nothing to find on the next planet because it's the same as all the other planets.  This game has huge scope and litte variety.  If you like crafting play Minecraft, if you want a space sim try Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen.  If you want both find another game cuz this isn't it."

This is the first time a company has gone from false advertising and borderline fraud to heartfelt dedication to their product. No sarcasm intended. Having said that the game as it stands is dull as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Every planet and every system feels exactly the same. This game shows the limits of procedural generation. They should've combined handcrafting with procedural generation. All activities boil down to collecting stuff and storing them. That's it. That's the whole point of the game. You collect stuff to build stuff, so you can collect more stuff and build more stuff. The art direction sucks. Take the weapons, there's no punch to them. Lead Designer said he didn't want to follow other Sci-Fi developers and make AK-47s in space. Well, he succeeded. Instead of AKs in space you get flashlights in space. Hooray. Fantastic. So fun to use. Weapons have no kick. The next time you try to reinvent the wheel you should understand why the wheel exists. That's what Kalashnikov said. Creatures aren't scary or awe-inspiring or anything. Aliens are cartoonish. There's no sense of wonder whatsoever.I'll probably come back to this game now and then just to see what's up. But as it stands it's just dull and boring."

Now imagine a company that makes a game with all the features you love. Then imagine they release it, and you get to play it.Well this is nothing like that, so keep on dreaming. Also, I think there is a lesson to be learned about pre purchasing games, and ill effects of blatantly lying in a WIP videogame, not sure... I sure wish these guys stick to Android and iOS games, and leave PC to professionals and indie developers who take their work more seriously.EDIT: Just wanted to add that, despite all the attempts to revitalize the game through new content, fixes and upgrades, those are just that, attempts, and fail to deliver fully implemented, or otherwise enjoyable content. They came too little, too late."

Don't make the same mistakes.This game is not at all what was promised.Certain aspects of the planet generation are pretty cool, but more in a tech-demo sort of way.  If there was a decent game occuring on those randomly generated planets, it might be alright.In general everything just seems the same, though.  There's nothing to make it a game.  I played a fair bit on the first half dozen planets, before I got bored of the grind.I didn't bother to finish, but it seems like you could grind in the first system to fully upgrade your ship/suit/gun (though I'm not sure it really matters) then just jump system to system, stopping occasionally to pick up the plentiful resources to refuel.Eventually you probably get to the middle if you're not too bored before then.There's no survival needed as far as I can tell.  Of the 8 or so planets I visited, There was a hot one, which required occasionally finding a shadow to sit in for 30 seconds to cool down.  There was a cold one, that required occasionally finding a cave to sit in for 30 seconds to warm up, there was one which drained my life support a little faster, so I had to keep stuffing it with plutonium (which is everywhere, so the only challenge is navigating the awful inventory screens)If you do accidentallyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off the sentinels by collecting resources without running around for a few seconds when they see you, you get to deal with the wanted meter, which works opposite of GTA which inspired it.Basically, kill all the sentinels quickly, and they stop coming.  Ignore them and your wanted level continues to rise.You will occasionally have one appear on the wrong side of a cave wall, or somewhere where it's totally inaccessable, but they can still see you through the walls, etc, and your wanted level will stay pretty high, and you need to either camp in the cave until something eventually times out and they go away, or go outside and get killed, which just increases your death counter by 1, and puts you back where you were.Upgrading your stuff is basically just about talking to one of the billions of carbon copy inhabitants in the carbon copy buildings, in the carbon copy settlements, on the quintilion carbon copy planets, while repeatedly getting the same blueprints you already have (I think I got 90% of them in the first couple hours, then it's just RNG to see if you get anything better)I don't think I need to waste any more time typing the same junk the other 70% of players who don't like this game have already said.Just don't buy it, okay?"

No Man's Sky is so shallow that you spend hours trying to find something fun to do in the game. Refunds should be given without question, I gave this game a chance, the benefit of the doubt and I'm stuck with it. Every planet has the same plants and minerals. Every outpost is the same copy and pasted outpost from a handful of maybe 3 different layouts.There is 1 type of space station in the entire game.Want to return to your starter planet or any other planet that you enjoyed, nearly impossible with the clumsy interface and controls."

After ofer 40h on this game (didn't reached the center 'cuzâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥it) all I can say is that if you're the type of person who enjoys running around gathering resources to spend on walking around gathering resources, then this it your game. Space is boring, space stations are boring, outposts are boring, animals are boring, aliens are the mostâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥boring thing of all. In an universe that discovered inter-stelar travel you would expect more than some weird-looking, non-moving alien saying  let me poke you with this needle  ... Some planets are awesome, most of them are not. This is a game where the most exiciting thing is discovering a drop pod so you can expand your inventory so you can gather more stuff. Ships are all the same control wise (customization is minimal) but yes, you could become a pirate (put more weapon companions) or a trader (put less weapons companions to have enough free space) if and only your imagination is rich enough. From my point of view the space part could be ignored all together. I spend almost 10 hours on a planet just to test one thing: Sean said that you could play the entire game that way. You could, if you're into boring shaite. I would not recommend anyone to play the game like that. Things become repetitive really fast, blueprints are all the same, and there are no new things to discover... so it's all a hunt for resources.Overall, I would say no way, not now, not when it's 60 bucks."

There's some really beautiful atmopsheres to the game and I wanted badly to enjoy it but overall it turns into the most boring game you will ever play. Every single world has the same aliens, same structures, same exact layout of general mundane tasks that will leave you contemplating your existence. To create such a vast universe where you're the only intelligent life...is about the worst concept of a game I could ever possibly think of. For the price of this game, you could not ask for a better way to get ripped off of your money."

There's not much I can say that hasn't been said already in all of the reviews.After 50+ hours in, it is pretty boring.  Just different coloration on each planet.  Animals all started looking the same.  And it's basically limitless grinding for resources/money rather than exploration.  Flight controls are terrible.  Interactions with other species is pointless and boring.  They literally just sit/stand there and do nothing.  All the same.And as I came back to this page to rate it I decided to watch some of the trailers again.  It is extremely disappointing that the game is nothing like what it appeared in the trailers.  But as revealed, that's because they were fairly scripted.There is nothing compelling me to keep playing this game.I don't recommend this game in the current state.  Hopefully they improve it."

This is probably the largest waste of money I've ever invested outside of this one time where I tried a flavoured lager which boasted a  real rum taste  but actually tasted like vomit. That's how I'd describe No Man's Sky. It leaves a taste much like vomit in my mouth, only, that's unfair - because it's more bland and less flavourful than vomit; see, vomit at least tastes bad, it has the capacity to actually register on the palatte as being foul. No Man's Sky is much more bland than that. It's bland, it's awful, it doesn't even nearly deliver on even a single one of its promises - and to top it off, it's bloody expensive for what it is. Do yourself a favour and avoid this game. And if it shows up somewhere unexpected please flip it off for me, because I'm one of those suckers who have been scammed by the robbing jerks who pushed this bucket o' crap out and took money from me under the pretense of offering me something fresh, unique, interesting... flip it off hard. Real hard."

She gave them gold, in return, they would have to launch their game with the last moon of summer. So be itâ¦ The game was launched, but with so many lies about it, so many bugs, that it was an epic disaster.  They could have surrendered, but they made an effort and continued working. One day after another, year after year ... until the end of 2018 when they launched NEXT, and feeling proud of their work, they continued working on their game, No man's sky.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1578817315  At the moment of this review I have played for 203 hours. Do I think this game is good, can I recommend it? YES. Right now, in 2018 I can say without doubt that I can recommend this game indeed. A few words about this game? This game, like a Phoenix, has reborn. I am playing a game that one year ago, no... A few months ago, I would have sworn to never play, and instead I am falling in love with it.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1578050772Graphics: This game has a really awesome graphics. Well, in fact, it not has the best optimization, I could recommend you to search for some easy guides, which will guide you to improve your FPS, your specs will matter and this game demands a good PC to run smooth, but it really worth. With time, some DLCs has been added to the game (free) improving everything, starting with NEXT, then ABYSS and with the last one, VISIONS, they have really improved the graphics. Music: Procedural music almost every track, well not really true, they partnered with rock band 65daysofstatic, and produced an experimental soundtrack, the music changes in-game. An example  HERE  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1585682339Story: There is one main story, a questline, the Atlas path whichâ¦ well I donât want to make spoilers, if you want to know how it finishes just use google. But I would recommend you to donât do itâ¦ And there is a secondary questline, the Artemis path, which will explain your origins and your destiny. Both of this quest will give you options, hard ones, and at the end you will have to do a difficult and no return choice.Gameplay: The gameplay, in short, is: DO WHAT YOU WANT. You will know that you start on a random planet, in the confines of the galaxy, with your ship damaged. From there, you will learn to collect resources, to trade, to build bases, to buy a freighter that you can convert into your permanent base; meet the alien races and their history, their language ... travel between systems exploring planets and moons, descending to the depths of the oceans, building bases in the stratosphere, staying with friends to make races with your vehicles in the circuit that you have built together;You will improve your suit, you will fly farther and longer, you will endure intense cold and deadly radiation; you will improve your ship and you will be able to jump more distance, opening the galactic map to your choice; you can become a pirate, a mercenary, a merchantâ¦ All that and more on a score of planets. Billions wait ...Or you can choose directly, to go through everything I said and go straight to the center of the galaxy, or follow the Atlas path; or meet with a friend who takes you to his planet and from there both of you continue together ... you choose.Negative point: This will sound weird but as negative I could say that you have TO MUCH TO DO!! Many days I enter to play thinking about exploring, but I end up improving my base or doing missions for the guilds or ..."

The title sold itself on grand expectations that did appear groundbreaking. The title received lofty claims before it release from multiple media outlets. When the game launched for play, the veneer of a groundbreaking space exploration adventure was quickly shattered . What was advertised as a nearly endless game of planetary exploration and space travel turned out to be a bland lifeless universe with new real rewards for discovery.                  The Procedural generated worlds are merely the same planet with different skins applied to them. If you name a life-form on one planet, they will have the same name on others, but with different colors. This standard is the same for life forms found on planets; same creatures with different color pallets. This is the moment where this reviewer requested a refund. The generated planets are void of life, personality, and most importantly anything fun too do. Perhaps the best description of No Man's Sky I have come across is, âAs vast as an ocean and as deep as a puddleâ. This statement wrings the loudest upon completing the only main quest line in the entire game.             As stated in the opening of this review video games released like No Man's Sky will be a direct contributor to a game industry collapse. This false advertisement is not a game, but a cash grab by mediocre developers. This is very obvious with the developers dodging very basic questions too service platforms like Steam and Amazon having to alter their refund policies to accommodate the mass exodus of rightfully dissatisfied customers. Over the past 5-6 years I have noticed a trend of game developers releasing incomplete titles, games that were not beta tested for errors and glitches, or a title spun as a groundbreaking gravy train turns out to be another game to add to the junk bin. This rush of selling titles like this at full price does nothing, but alienate and cause distrust between the game consumers and game developers. I am glad Steam and other services like it realized this and accommodated accordingly. A video game like No Man's Sky breaks down the integrity between consumer and maker.             I must take some personal responsibility for making this purchase on a whim. I gave it an unbiased chance since I don't consume large quantities of video game related media; I had a relatively little knowledge of this game beforehand. After playing it for myself I found that the negative reviews everywhere are accurate. This whole debacle as been a learning experience for me and I hope it will be for anyone else who made this purchase to be a little more inquisitive and skeptical of lavish praise before something is completed and tried. I have a biting feat that is something similar were to happen to a major game series or title that it could be a major hit to the game industry as a whole and take an E.T. Atari effect bringing about a decline and interest in video games overall."

But after a couple of jumps you realise it has nothing new to offer, and it becomes an endless grind to reach a place you have no worthwhile motivation to go to. You could save the money and time and instead go for a hike in the mountains."

Don't believe what the pictures and videos show you, it's all just a big ole scam.What I also find interesting is you can buy an aliens ship, or find a crashed ship on a planet... HOW DID THE ALIENS CRASH IF YOUR SHIP CANT EVEN GET WITHIN 500m OF THE GROUND. It's essentially space explorer for children and you sit in a little high chair with auto pilot on and watch the stars go by.Don't buy it."

Such a cool and beautiful style was used when considering the art for this game which i can really appreciate, but i would have settled with worse graphics and a complete story/working game play any day."

For awhile, the universe the game has created is certainly unique and  dynamic . However after several hours of gameplay, it really isn't, it is all just reskins/reshuffled arrangements of each other. Also, the range of things you can do within is limited, REALLY limited. In addition to that, the game suffers from a lack of innovation in terms of game objectives and npcs. I really wanted to say something nice about the game, and was hoping that it could at least deliver the same amount of fun I had playing freelancer back in 2000. Finally, there is no real point in any of the  objectives  in the game, ship/exosuit/gun upgrades are for nothing, there is really no point in grinding for any of it. If I had known how this game was going to turn out, I wouldn't have prepurchased it. Imho, in its current state, it would only be acceptable as an early access game and it definitely SHOULD NOT be priced at $60.TL;DR There is no plot, the game is anything but polished, do not buy this game.Petition for refund: https://www.change.org/p/hello-games-compensation-for-no-man-s-sky-players?recruiter=586834862&utm_source=share_for_starters&utm_medium=copyLink"

I have a pretty nice Rig (Involves GTX 1080) and the game still runs at very choppy frame rates especially when im in the ship above the planets. Not to mention the game has crashed in critical times where i had been farming for materials and i end up losng my recent data. There have also been many claims from Hello Games & Sean Murray with features that were suppose to be in the game but are still not included in the current build. I wouldn't recomend anybody to purchase this game until they fix it and live up to their claims, Thanks you."

The devs promised so so much and delievered on almost none of it, feels like the exploration part of the Mass Effect series, but something you pay full price for. Really buggy, gave me about 15fps on my 1080, i6700k, the update made it worse, to the point of it being unplayable."

This is an unfinished product as far as I am concerned.+ Soundtrack- Ships have no variation and handle like crap. Only point to buying a new one is for the inventory space so that you can continue grinding for materials for 1000 hours. - Menu is shockingly optimised, poorly designed and a nightmare to navigate.- After a while planets start to lack variation.- Space combat is terrible.- Combat in general is as rudimental and basic as it comes.- No meaningful objectives such as side quests or anything of that nature.- All of the aliens are the same recycled NPCs. The same goes for any other event or ? icon that you find. No variation or thought put into the gameplay at all.- Riddled with bugs and glitches. This game is in no state for commercial release. - 60 dollars for a below par, unfinished and deceptive product.I could go on, but I would be typing for hours. This game might be worth a few dollars once all of the patches (paid DLC disguised as 'updates') fix it and hopefully make it better overall. As of now, Hello Games is a money-grabbing group of liars that sold dreams to the public in order to haev a nice cash-grab."

Tech / ship upgrades are largely meaningless as their practical application is so boring. Combat is repetative and only really challenging because the enemies are endlesslessly spawing, erratic bullet-sponges.The whole experience feels, looks & sounds like a Â£10 early access at best."

After my patience ran out i stopped playing. I  kept up on a lot of the news for the game and watched a few videos and it is really starting to make me angry. I didn't realize how much was promised in this game that wasn't delivered. It is one thing to make an E3 trailer look better, but to flat out fake it is disgraceful and the company should feel ashamed. I always try not to watch too many videos before a game comes out so i can experience it myself. That's why I didn't get to hyped for the game, but i can imagine why so many people are disappointed in the game, you were cheated and lied to. I wish i did watch all those videos before the game came out so i could have know what was going on sooner and  refunded the game. This kind of thing can't be tolerated, it is false advertising and the gaming community needs to start standing up to thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥The game would have been fine without the lying and if it had a modest indie price. These companies are greedy and are trying to squeeze as much money possible out of us as they can while doing as little work as possible. The problem is that we are buying these games. We need to stop buying them or demand refunds if it's falsely advertised. It's not just half games being charged full price but season passes and micro transactions as well. If we buy them then it won't stop. Theyâre always going to push the their luck as far as they can so we need to draw a line. It's too late for me to refund my game but i can still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on social media all day about it."

And it was to start with but it rapidly became apparent that the content that was advertised just wasn't there. Everything the game has to offer can be experienced within a couple of hours. Now for a full price game I don't find this acceptable. I carried on playing in the hope that it would get better but it really didn't. I can only hope for the developer to update the content in the game in the future without resorting to paid DLC.Given the misleading nature of what was promised from the developer and advertised as such within steam I requested a refund from steam which was refused. So it appears that Steam/Valve are happy to condone false advertising of a game and will collaborate in deception as long as they get their cut. Well from now on I will do everything I can to obtain my games from other channels."

Their can be absouletly no way Hello Games could have played this and gone  yeah we got a good game on our hands . They released either too early under pressure or with blinding confidence.Half of the game is pointless grind - You need plutonium or such other minerals to constantly fulfil you hungy ship/gun/suit but its in abundance so going through the collect->go through slow refill process->depltete->collect is pointless and boring.The flora and fauna look basically the same after a few worlds (so why bother with them), the  combat  is as one dimensional as the alien races you  interact  with (in other words very) and the off world experience had no value what so ever. Avoid this  game  until its bargain basement or (and i dounbt this will happen) they actually make a game of this.It can look pretty and the music very atmospheric but its still a tech demo rapped in AAA pricing."

They oversold and underprovided. After you've visited a few planets, you will begin to realize, EVERYTHING is the same *jazz hands* BUT DIFFERENT. /booooring :steamsalty:As you can see I've spent 2 hours on the game this last week, about 24 total. Enough time for me to find out if I would continue playing this game.No Man's Sky is an endless Universe with limited possibilities and the same monotonous long distance grind with complete and total emptiness. I can't help but feel lonely myself upon playing it. The sheer vastness and size of the in game Universe simply reminds me of humanities loneliness in this massive Universe of our own.As far as entertainment goes, No Man's Sky, a game I have anticipated for years; simply does not serve its purpose. In many ways I do feel tricked by the developers, they did a fantastic job keeping development on this game very 'hush hush', and continually delayed the release until they could release 'the best possible product'. Well I have to say guys, your best was definitely not good enough.I'd say I wasted 60$ on this, but in all honesty I have wasted more than that. The whole experience has become monotonous and a complete and utter let down, most of the plants on each planet is the same, many of the same models used for the creatures, there is very little variety after you have been to 15-20 different planets. The energy I've spent looking for as much information I could about this game, and getting all of my friends amped up about it too; I really just feel like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot for getting tricked like this.I'll probably play it again some other time...Hopefully they use the money they have gained from this to continue improvement on it, I'm going to be more careful and wait next time when a game of this size comes from such a small studio, it is endless repetitiveness.Probably a crappy review, I'm not very good at this but whatever, I hope it helps some people realize this game is not worth 60$ with the amount of content it actually provides. It has 18 trillion different planets, each with basically the same stuff on it; not all that exciting."

(Lies)In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.  (no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again. Because there is no multiplayer)Embark on an epic voyage (Lies)At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit. (THE GRIND.... for nothing)Find your own destiny (Lies)Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry. Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards. (XD the inventory is a joke, LIES)Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.Share your journeyThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space. Perhaps you will see the results of their actions as well as your own...     (The discription of the game says it the best ....   no other players )In other words, this game is Trash painted to look like a gift and with just enough content to have you play till you can't go back and refund.   10/10 Would suffer again!"

It looked fantastic and I promised my son that we would buy it.  I pre-ordered it to get a ship.When I first played it, there didn't seem to be much to it, but I figured that it would build up gradually and I would soon see some of the promised content. However, it became clear that every planet was pretty much the same, there is no depth to the interaction with aliens, no ship customisation, no epic space battles, no depth to the trading system.This game is not worth the Â£40 that I paid for it.  I couldn't even get a refund because it took me more than two hours to realise how bad it is.In my opinion, it was falsely advertised, and the developer appears to have made no effort to add any of the promised content that was missing."

The first 5 hours were enjoyable. After that, the generic aliens just got annoying.Needed mods to fix some of the terrible design decisions, like that god-awful suit voiceover and the idiotic spring that pervents players from flying close to or even aiming towards the ground on planets.Was hoping to see some great content additions and fixes to the problems/missing features after a couple months, but so far Hello Games seems to be dead and buried. Office is reported to be abandoned and refunds are being blocked (specifically by Sony for PS4, but the trend could sprial out).DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Devs have likely completely abandoned ship. Game is too repetitive to even be a chill stroll in the park with nice visuals as it currently stands, and doesn't seem to have any future."

The content that is showcased in the gameplay and pre-release trailers do not reflect the final product at all. There is literally nothing new to do in this game after about 2 hours. Even if you force yourself to explore the universe, you'll quickly learn how repetative and limited the procedural generation is. 18 quintillion planets and none of them feel truly unique. This game only left one impression on me and the majority of the people who played it, a very bad one. Do not support Hello Games ever. They do not even actively communicate with the players post-release because they KNOW they released a game that failed to tackle 80% of its promises and have no answers to give."

Tech / ship upgrades are largely meaningless as their practical application is so boring. Combat is repetative and only really challenging because the enemies are endlesslessly spawing, erratic bullet-sponges.The whole experience feels, looks & sounds like a Â£10 early access at best."

After my patience ran out i stopped playing. I  kept up on a lot of the news for the game and watched a few videos and it is really starting to make me angry. I didn't realize how much was promised in this game that wasn't delivered. It is one thing to make an E3 trailer look better, but to flat out fake it is disgraceful and the company should feel ashamed. I always try not to watch too many videos before a game comes out so i can experience it myself. That's why I didn't get to hyped for the game, but i can imagine why so many people are disappointed in the game, you were cheated and lied to. I wish i did watch all those videos before the game came out so i could have know what was going on sooner and  refunded the game. This kind of thing can't be tolerated, it is false advertising and the gaming community needs to start standing up to thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥The game would have been fine without the lying and if it had a modest indie price. These companies are greedy and are trying to squeeze as much money possible out of us as they can while doing as little work as possible. The problem is that we are buying these games. We need to stop buying them or demand refunds if it's falsely advertised. It's not just half games being charged full price but season passes and micro transactions as well. If we buy them then it won't stop. Theyâre always going to push the their luck as far as they can so we need to draw a line. It's too late for me to refund my game but i can still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on social media all day about it."

And it was to start with but it rapidly became apparent that the content that was advertised just wasn't there. Everything the game has to offer can be experienced within a couple of hours. Now for a full price game I don't find this acceptable. I carried on playing in the hope that it would get better but it really didn't. I can only hope for the developer to update the content in the game in the future without resorting to paid DLC.Given the misleading nature of what was promised from the developer and advertised as such within steam I requested a refund from steam which was refused. So it appears that Steam/Valve are happy to condone false advertising of a game and will collaborate in deception as long as they get their cut. Well from now on I will do everything I can to obtain my games from other channels."

Their can be absouletly no way Hello Games could have played this and gone  yeah we got a good game on our hands . They released either too early under pressure or with blinding confidence.Half of the game is pointless grind - You need plutonium or such other minerals to constantly fulfil you hungy ship/gun/suit but its in abundance so going through the collect->go through slow refill process->depltete->collect is pointless and boring.The flora and fauna look basically the same after a few worlds (so why bother with them), the  combat  is as one dimensional as the alien races you  interact  with (in other words very) and the off world experience had no value what so ever. Avoid this  game  until its bargain basement or (and i dounbt this will happen) they actually make a game of this.It can look pretty and the music very atmospheric but its still a tech demo rapped in AAA pricing."

It has all of the above and more, is much more realistic (e.g. planets have gravity and you can crash and die if you get your landing wrong) with way better graphics and meaningful game progression. Watch a YouTube how to video, and you'll immediately see the difference. And way, way more importantly it has a developer who loves the game and has been invested in it since back when it was first released as a ground breaking wire-frame 3D back in 1984.None of this can be said about NMS in its current form.I might come back to visit NMS one day, but right now it's a pile of pixel-stank. Not worth a buy.Seriously, if you want to drop your coin on a space game, Elite Dangerous is the go."

I don't recommend it, but I also don't think that someone should immediately turn their cheek to it either. It was an ambitious game from the start, and I wish they'd just taken the safety net of Early Access so they could claim the game as it is; in development. A team of 15 people were not going to pull this off. Even with Sony backing, it wasn't happening. I personally feel like this is comparable to ARK: Survival Evolved. IF they hadn't taken the Early Access. Which is why I haven't refunded, I feel as though the devs are being honest, and they just got way in over their heads. A lot of the reviews are quite harsh, which is understandable because, at the moment, this game is far from what it was advertised and hyped as and, for that reason, is not worth $60. At the moment, you have a barebones Indie game. But the potential is there, if Hello Games sticks to their guns and lets their actions speak for themselves. I want to love this game, but right now I can't. As it is right now, you'll spend a good portion of time waiting after pressing A+D to use your hyperdrive. Then wait. And wait. And wait. You get the point. It tells you how long until you arrive, and most of the time, without the hyperdrive, it can be upwards of an hour. With the hyperdrive, it's still between 5-10 minutes. And once you make it to that planet, you'll begin landing sequence, wait about 10-30 seconds to land. Once you're out of the ship, you wander. That's basically it. You wander around, harvest some resources so you can keep using that hyperdrive. You'll see some neat looking creatures, and some weird looking creatures. You'll get back to your ship, and repeat the process.Give me the update that makes this game a big, juicy steak of a game that it was hyped to be, and I'll change this review immediately."

I've sank over 300 hundred hours in on my  main  PS4 save, and built my first gaming PC almost two months ago, in order to enjoy the amazing mods that are out there - to keep me busy until NEXT releases one week from today.

And im not talking about  Elite Dangerous Im talking about ELITE. See the excerpt below. Elite is a space trading video game, written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984 Yes, THAT Elite. From back in 1984.So, honestly, there really is nothing new here.Dont even bother with this title.Not untill they add all the things they were SUPPOSED to have in the game from launch. And Even then, any add on should be FREE like Sean said THE DAY THE GAME was released.He even took THAT promise back. what aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!!"

Wait, what textures?- no ui scaling of any sort. If you have a large, high resolution monitor, enjoy gigantic icons and UI elementsThe mouse+keyboard controls are utterly horrible.Space dogfight is especially bad for anyone who tried space sims ever. You want to fight pirates? Go and play Freespace 1 + 2 (and check out the open source project) and don't look back ever. Controls are very mushy, reaction time of the ship is just ridiculous. You push the mouse up, the ship does not move. You get tired, try pushing down, now it starts to react. To the up. Try hitting targets like that.Every time you want to accept / change anything, you have to press the mouse button down and hold. As if you were using a controller. Even if you just want to change the  texture detail  (lol) from Medium to High.The mouse wheel is not used in the options menu, or the cursor / wasd keys. You have to click the up/down buttons to advance the list of options.Mouse position resets to the middle of the screen every time you change menus or menu tabs.Generic UI problems- There is no separate menu for crafting.- You can only view your recepies if you have a free inventory space- you cannot exchange two items unless you have a free inventory space to temporarily move one of them there- no  upload all discoveries  option- the starmap simply does not work as a map. There is no zoom to have an overview of the galaxy segment, or even see more than your current star system at once.Deisgn problems:Unfortunately, there are more problems. The creatures are very, very generic most of the time. Quadrupled antilop/deer/cat/cow grazing animal, hunter spider-thing. The guardian drones are an annoyance, and if you hide inside your ship, 75% of the time they lose sight of you. The large advanced dog-drone (that looks like that DARPA dog-robot) is bugged if you use grenades on it and will enter a state of permanent semi-death....and so on. You can guess from here.And that from a â¬60 game that did not have regional pricing, or preorder discount. (Thus it cost me 50% more than any AAA-game locally.) Shame on you! This is a â¬30 launch price game, not even close to â¬60!If you want space fight, go with Freespace 1-2. If you want great moody graphics, go with Firewatch. If you want infinite terrain, go with Minecraft. If you want weird creatures, go with Spore, although that's not a good game either. But don't go with No Man's Sky, it's not the sum of the above, just the sum of the covers of the above. It has none of the substance, enough problems for dozens of indie games, and a price for dozens too."

The loot is boring, performs likeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on my pc, planets are bland and kind of similar, your spaceships are practically identical with the exception of loot space and design.

Hopefully it gets patched enough or some DLC that addresses the shortcomings but until then it is not worth sixty bucks.Watch a Youtube video of someone playing - since you can do that for free and is the most enjoyable part of what you are capable of doing in the game... just looking at something you haven't yet seen. :(*Really* wanted to like this game, since endless procedural worlds is so promising. Kept thinking maybe I just need to see one more world, or if I put up with the time and grind of learning the alien's language, or if I make it to the center of the galaxy it will all be worth it.IT IS NOT."

The atlas path and the journey to the center are boring and lack any real reward or meaning. this game lacks what it was promised in so many ways. One of which i am particularly disspointed in is the inability name my ship or upgrade it. (installing items is not upgrading it if i have to sell it or abandon it after working so hard on it.)I do not recommend buying this game, dispite how joyessly i awaited it and tried to forgive its flaws and lies."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 27, 2016              Do not recommend to the average consumer.Let me get this straight, I LOVED the first 6 or 7 hours of this game. It was stunning. -The graphics, while simple, are beautiful in the right situation.-The feeling of being able to launch into space, boost to another planet, land, rinse and repeat is easily one of the most groundbreaking feelings out there. -The design of everything in this game is so special. From the geometric space stations, to the grass on a lush planet, to the crystalized formations of minerals, to the ships and tools themselves, it is very unique and nice to look at.There are so many good things about this game. You are probably confused about why I'm not recommending it after all of this, right?The problem is, the cons simply outweigh the pros.-The gameplay gets very repetitive, and managing each aspect of your inventory is downright annoying.-If I hear  Technology Recharged  one more time I'm going to throw myself into the vacuum of the cosmos in nothing but my underwear.-There just isn't enough. As you've probably heard a million times,  Wide as an Ocean, Deep as a Puddle.  (More on this later.)-Too many different performance problems across different rigs.-Combat just doesn't have enough depth. I'm not saying there should be a FOCUS on combat, but it needs to be more than aim and M1. (Which is hard enough on its own with these controls).-Controls for flight are hardly responsive in atmosphere. For some reason they felt it was necessary to not let your spaceship get within 1,000 feet of the surface (hyperbole), and whenever you do, controls just stop working. I can't go up, I can't turn, etc. Definitely not what we saw in trailers.There are so many more nitpicky stuff I can get into, but it would take me all day.The big problem I have isn't that Sean Murray  lied  or anything. Hello Games really didn't say ANYTHING about the game's features. That's the main issue. Because we knew nothing, our minds ran wild with ideas. I never believed we would get multiplayer. I never believed we would get a fleshed out story. I never believed we would even get to shoot things up until I figured out I could. The utter silence from HG on what we do and don't have ruined the game for many people.If you like games where you have no real goals and you just run around and do whatever, I would recommend at least LOOKING INTO this game. I can't recommend getting it. The game can't even live up to that. There just isn't enough you can do. In other sandboxes, there are far more options to play with. There's only really 3 things you can do in this game. Fly, Recharge, Collect. All of these things blend together too much in order to be really different from each other. We were showed 3 main pillars of the game that sort of served as  paths  the player can follow. That was all but a lie.Paths:-NO specialization of ships, Suits, diplomacy, trading, etc. for the Trader path. The only trading you do is selling whatever you've happened to pick up along the way at a terminal. There are no  trader ships. -NO specialization of ships, suits, factions, combat, etc. for the Fighter path. Pirating ships isn't rewarding in the slightest. There isn't a large enough difference in ship stats to make a difference in combat, which is shallow at best. There are no  fighting ships.  I never saw a single fleet battle in all my hours of play, and only one pirate attack.-NO specialization of ships, suits, tools, etc. for the Explorer path. You'd think that there would be at least SOMETHING different, right? Np. There is no difference in any path.The thing that finally turned this game off for me was the lack of any goal. I never expected a  story mode  or quests, but this is just ridiculous. They say the goal is to  reach the center of the galaxy,  but even that seems to have been a lie. At the supposed center there is just a warp to ANOTHER GALAXY REGION. I've heard theories about  a secret story  and  THE REAL ENDING,  but that is hardly a good thing.Conclusion: No Man's Sky was just not enough for the ambition it radiated. The game was just not enough to be what it should've been. The gameplay is stale and repetitive, and cannot support the experience. There just isn't enough. After a solid couple of hours, you feel like you've done it all. If you like repetitive games, take a look, but don't be surprised if it's not for you. Hello Games didn't advertise what their game was, just what it should've been.And now that they may start doing paid DLC for stuff that should've been in the game in the first place, nah, I'm out."

After playing it on launch day and seeing half the things talked about not even exist in the slightest was a huge let down. The game super buggy and is honestly just repetitive super quickly: mine ores, look for structures, trade, rinse and repeat. If like these 3 things, CONGRATS THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you like games that are full of excitement and are actually fun to play, I suggest you avoid this game."

If you have the disposable income necessary to not worry about the price then I would say get it but if the $60 dollars is all you would have to spend on games then I recommend spending it more wisely as there are much better games out there for cheaper. I hope to see them continue patching the game and eventually reaching the type of game that many of us hoped it could be."

It really feels like living as a space explorer, fully immersive. The other millions of survival games where you're stuck in a piece of land look so archaic compared to No Man's Sky.Moreover, there's always something to do, and everything is well-rewarded.â¢ Just wanna enjoy the story? Yes, there's actually a story that you can followâ¢ Wanna chill while listening to a podcast or something else? Just explore the planet for artifacts and resourcesâ¢ Wanna be a space cowboy fighting pirates? Patrol and scan the space or bring valuable items in your ship, or take missionsâ¢ Wanna become a space trader? Hop around different systems, buy low in system A and sell high in system B, or gather them yourselfâ¢ Wanna become a space pirate? Just attack random people in space, you can also attack motherships and steal their stuffâ¢ Wanna become a space commander? Get yourself a mothership and command spaceships to do various tasks for youâ¢ Wanna build your dream home base on an alien planet? Yes, you can build your base basically everywhere, it's quite robustâ¢ And there are still many other stuff to do in the game that I've yet to encounter, it's kinda overwhelming actually. Kudos to the developers for not giving up on the game after the backlash in 2016. NEXT is such an amazing turnaround, they deserve all the success and praise."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 12, 2017              This is the  Spore  of 2016.  A game that promised way more than it could deliver.  An open universe where you fly from world to world, star to star.  Planets with unique ecosystems, some barren, some brimming with life.  Man that would be a great game.If planets have animals they're going to have somewhere between 5 and 15 varieties ... on the whole planet.  For plants it will be less. There's no concept of biomes at all.  Once you land on a world and spend a minute walking around, you can leave, you've seen everything the planet has to offer.  If that's all there is, making a huge planet is just a waste of time, why bother?Furthermore there is a remarkable sameness from world to world.  Once you've seen a cave on one world, you have literally seen every cave on every world.  None of them are inhabited.  Certain key resources (platinum, zinc,  thamium9 ) come from flowers (for some inexplicable reason) and the flowers pretty much look identical on every world.The creatures you come across are depressing.  Rather than creatively designing rules that evolve creatures for the environment they are in, instead the game seems to simply roll dice and create unrealistic chimeras by combining parts of earth animals  deer head, cat paws, antlers, ...  etc.  Nothing seems particularly unique to No Man's Sky and once you've encountered a few creatures, you'll note that the  toolbox  of  creature parts  is pretty small.Worlds don't appear to be inhabited by intelligent life as you might expect... there are no  cities  or  towns .  You will occasionally come across a shelter that might have ONE alien in it, but no evidence of any sort of indigenous intelligence or even small settlements.  Interactions with aliens boil down to multiple choice questions.  Get the right answer and you might get a few resources or units of currency--but no sweeping arc of any grand story is affected by your interactions.The controls are bad, particularly the flight controls, oftentimes you have to try to land your ship without being able to see what you are landing on, or fight in space without being able to see what you are supposed to be shooting at.  A number of interface decisions in the game are just downright wonky (on the PC version anyway).Ultimately this appears to be a thin veneer of a game that can't possibly measure up to how it was billed by the makers.  You can probably get a few hours of fun out of it but the novelty wears off real quick. You wouldn't expect a game which takes an entire galaxy as it's setting to be far far FAR less detailed and immersive than say  Skyrim  but it is, and that's just sad.For the amount of entertainment it offers, the game would be appropriately priced at $14.99.  I picked it up on sale for $35, and that was still too much money.  If you are desperate to try it, my advice is wait.  It *will* be selling dirt cheap some day, there's just not enough here to warrant anything more."

It features space exploration, trading, crafting, base building and now a story of some kind. Its not a super realistic space sim so its nice for those people who like to just sit back and relax. If a more realistic space sim is more your thing try Elite Dangerous. Currently, I found No Man's Sky to be a bit above your standard Early Access Survival titles. It definitely did change since release. They've steered it in the right direction. They have added quite a few major patches which help give the game more of that much needed content."

Luckily, I had no start up issues and played straight away. I was always in a constant state of suspense like  I bet an insane, mind-boggling moment is just about to happen ...but unfortunately they just don't. Ever. No Man's Sky kind of sucks but it is important, as it lays a base-plate/model concept for games to build on and actually deliver what wasn't promised, but what was implied (SUCH AS STAR CITIZEN CHECK IT OUT). Sean Murray, although he's been pointed out to be contradictory, fooled us all. I look back retrospectively through all the YouTube videos and IGN coverage and it all makes sense. He showed us what was in the game, and our minds ran wild with the 'coulds'...unfortunately, he made no effort to correct speculation, or quell unwarranted hype because it was free marketing for Hello Games. If you were Sean Murray (a deceptive dawg), and you were making a game and suddenly it was the most hyped game of the last 5 years and you knew you were about to be made filthy, filthy rich. Would you tell people  Don't get carried away!  or would you just let it simmer and people be disappointed.I feel and think we would all want to make the right choice, but many of us would be corrupted.

Very minimal content and redundant gameplay. Better stick to Rust/ARKS/Minecraft/7 Days to Die for better game experience and value for money. This game is mainly for those who like the space exploration/sci-fi element but if you're looking for something other than what I said above, then look for another game. #NoMansBuy #NoMansRefund"

Although after seeing all of the cut content, which was gutted for absolutely no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reason, I simply CANNOT recommend this game to ANYONE. Huge segments were cut out months before release, why? Nobody â¥â¥â¥â¥ing knows, probably to be sold as DLC because Hello Games didn't get enough cash from all of the hype they generated.There is so much content missing it felt like I was playing an EA alpha. All of the cool things like space battles between factions are gone, desert planets are gone, trading ships landing and taking off are gone. Ripped out for god knows why. A mile wide but an inch deep perfectly describes this game and I regret buying it. Hello Games doesn't care though, Sean or however the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you spell it doesn't care, he's happy so long as he continues to con people out of their money with his lies and broken promises. Someone should â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sue this company for false advertisement. Multiplayer? Nope, that's gone. Unique ships of different classes? Nope, also gone. Naming a particular type of ship and then anyone with that type of ship having that name? Guess what, that's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gone too. NMS builds up the goal of getting to the center of your  universe  or a galaxy but there's nothing there, someone went through 11 galaxies and nothing. I cannot recommend this overhyped, unfinished piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ No Man's Sky? More like No Man's Buy. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. Big reviewers can explain it better than I, Angry Joe has made a much better review, but at this point I don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing care, I've already been scammed. Have fun with my Â£40 Sean you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTTPlqK8AnY*EDIT*https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4zlqpw/went_back_to_my_starting_planet_and_every/It would seem that player discoveries are being wiped, so all of your hard work is for nothing.*EDIT AGAIN*Steam have now allowed anyone to refund this  game  regardless of play time, so you can actually get your money back. Thank you Valve!*EDIT FOR THE FINAL (I HOPE) TIME*I have now received a refund, and I couldn't be happier. Thank you Valve and Steam Support!"

It just doesn't have enough diversity in gameplay, gather 12 types of minerals to get bigger ships so you can store more minerals.You can also upgrade your weapons a lot BUT you won't be facing anything that you can't kill with you first weapon easily. So overall EASY game, nothing is dangerous. Second part is that all planets looks and feels the same. There is small differences, this planet had a crab with eight legs instead of six, same types of buildings are on every planet with the same things inside. Interior in all building looks the same on every planet. After spending 13h of my time on this game i would like my money back because this game is just a big place with no content.LAST OF ALL! REMOVE THE TRAILERS!! The game does not look like that!!"

The game is phenomenally deep in some respects (chiefly the sheer size of the universe) and then just as shallow in others. When one has played a sandbox game like Eve Online and is presented with the similarly sci-fi No Man's Sky, it feels incredibly limiting.Thank you to Steam for accepting my refund request."

The main measure of the games progression is in weapon/ship/suit inventory slots.  I feel the whole  traveling to the center of the universe  is a very small part.  You spend most of your time farming, running out of inventory space/resources (by design) and having short dialogs that repeat over and over again throughout the game.  They've designed this game so that you need resources to breath, fly, shoot, be outside, etc, etc, etc, SIMPLY because, without that, there wouldn't be enough to do.  I truly feel that a moment spent in this game is a complete waste of my time.There is no leveling up and you don't even have to leave the first planet to max out on inventory slots.  In my humble opinion, the game design will turn off most of it's players.  Even the ones that give positive reviews are either too new to the game or just straight up liars.  I wish I could get a refund from Steam but unfortunately I spent too much time trying to prove to myself that there must be something more to this game."

It was slow, it was repetitive, and it lacked depth.  There was very little to actually DO- I didn't much care for all the drama around the hype; it was disappointing yes, but my main issues were the lack of things to do.Now that there've been some updates, the game is much, much better! It's still slow, and it's still repeptitive. But if you enjoy a solo experience where you do the grind and get the rewards, it's a good game. It still has some major flaws in my opinion, mostly lost opportunities- all the bases, and space stations look the same with only exceedingly minor differences. There's still only like, 3 people in a space station, and the conversations and interactions are just as shallow as before. The pilots of the ships that dock at trade ports and space stations never get out of their ships- overall, the universe is a lonely feeling place, with just the barest of hints at the life and cultures around you. The overhyped 'random creatures' you find on planets are all still very, very samey, as is all the planets plant life. Supposedly that's been updated as well, but I haven't really traveled very far in the 40 hours I've played since the latest update, and haven't seen anything I hadn't seen the first time around. That's not to say you don't find neat things, and I have for sure, but MOST of the fauna I've encountered have all looked much the same across the planets I've visited.All around though, it's a better experience. There are minor quests you can do to earn some money and items. There's a new and improved main quest chain to work on, probably the best addition I've noticed, which leads you through building a base, and getting your land rover thingy, as well as upgrades and craftables. There's much more of a goal in mind than 'fly around between planets'. Flying the ships feels good, and every ship feels different in it's maneuverability; space combat feels better as well, provided you've outfitted your ship with weapons and upgrades and own one with decent manueverability. You can also buy the enormous Freighters that warp in near space stations, and keep multiple ships on them, though they're exceedingly expensive and it's a late game prospect. The graphics are great, though there are some stylistic choices that some people don't like. I think they're fine.  I'm personally not a huge fan of the menus and UI, but it does the job. Some things are still frustratingly random, like finding upgrades you want, or new multitools, or decent ships.It's nice that the developers have continued to work on the game- there's still a LOT they could do, and I hope they continue, but they've made a good effort so far and persisted despite the hate train around their game, which is commendable. They've done enough now that I could happily recommend this game to the right person.So yeah, I'd recommend this game for sure-IF you do proper research and know what you're getting. Don't go into it expecting it to be something that it isn't and get upset about it. Watch some videos and read the RECENT in depth reviews. Know that it's a very time consuming game, that's focused around exploration, and it's slow to play. It rewards time and effort, and you need to know if those rewards are going to be enough payoff for you. It's a gorgeous game and a great experience, but only for the right person!"

The planets do NOT look alike at all when comparing the view from space and on the ground.= Sound is a 5/10, it's okay, and some creatures make really cute noises, but the UI voice is just obnoxious. Compared to Elite Dangerous this is even more prevalent since you can see what an amazing sound design, sounds like.= Gameplay is a 3/10: The procedural generation is good, but the game revolves around constantly going back to the same small set of pre-built structures... What the hell?= Controls is a 1/10: Flight gameplay is a horrible, Land gameplay is only passable because of a bug that enables you to move faster than you should.Should be priced 20â¬ / 25$"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 31, 2016              Overall - Pretty Poor90% of the planets are the same - and the ones that aren't are rare. In 15 hours of playtime, I found 2 planets that didn't fit into the same red-rock mould; 1 moon with some snow, and 1 flora planet.Fauna is nowhere near as complex as shown in game demos. Food chains don't exist as shown and animals have no noticable interactions with each other. Dinosaurs like those which are shown in the gameplay trailer, and there is very little difference between species on different planets - the same few appear everywhere.No massive fleets jump in to star systems like shown in the gameplay trailer, as well as no large scale space battles where you can pick a side. At most 2 or 3 do, and a couple of pirates attack them infinetely until you join in. Even then, you can in duck in and out of a space station until you eventually kill them.Speaking of space stations, they were talked about as if they would be hubs for trading and interactions. Instead, you have a space station the size of a moon inhabited by a single NPC, with a few ships appearing every now and then.It was also advertised that you could take multiple routes in terms of your ship, either opting to take an exploration, fighting, or trading ship. This simply isn't true. All of the ships handle the same, with the same speed and same weapons. The only thing you're really looking for in a ship is the inventory size. Other than that they are all the same with a slightly different model and paint-job.There is no multiplayer, another feature that was lied about. You could spend over 20 hours trying to reach the same planet as a friend, only to find that you can't see or interact with one another once you arrive.By far the worst thing about No Man's Sky is the number of bugs.On multiple occasions I would explore a planet 100% completion at which point I would be prompted to claim a reward. At this point, I would then try and upload a planet only for the game to tell me that I hadn't found everything, even though all boxes were checked and the game said 100% complete.The game is also terribly optimised, so much so that even high-end gaming PCs struggle to run it at a constant FPS, not to mention crashes, which are far too abundant. I probably spent more time loading into the game than actually playing it. What made this even worse is that a lot of the time, No Man's Sky would ignore my restore points unless I saved multiple times, resulting in several insanely frustrating moments where a planet I had completed would be uncompleted within seconds.The only thing worse than this however, is not being able to fully research a planet at all. Often, I would reach a point where I only needed to find 1 species, only to then find that this species was perpetually locked into the floor, where I was completely unable to scan it.Clipping through objects is also much more common than it should be. Whether in an exosuit or a spaceship, you can move through various objects as if you were a ghost, further damaging your immersion in the game.Other problems with No Man's Sky include the variation. The game is supposed to take place in a galaxy, but I feel like I'm exploring a loop, with the same unending rock planets. Planetery gravity, an addition that might have made planets feel more unique, is unsurprisingly absent as well as orbits. Planets sit stationary around a sun.Sentinels, the game's main antagonistic force, are always samey. Passive walker sentinels don't exist like they do in the gameplay trailer. If you see a two-legged sentinel it is hostile no exceptions.One of the most anticlimactic and disappointing endings in videogame history.Overall, even with promises of future updates, Â£40/$60 is too much for this game. Overhyping and flat-out lying has been used to lure in players in. Don't buy this game, even if the price drops."

Conclusion, verdict and ratings at the bottom if ya don't like reading.When it comes down to it everybody is annoyed because this game is great but it could have been better.Pros:Incredibly ambitiousStill being updated for free ( small devoted dev team)loads of new features since releaseHuge (seemly endless space)Brilliant audio so immersive and in sync with the game and situations (music and effects)Pretty graphicsBase buildingBase creation sharing with the communityNo money making DLCLoads of ships including giant ones (purchasable) alternate means of transport (planetary vehicles)Great style and consistent (reminiscent to spore)Huge replay valueStill loads of featuresGood mechanicsHuge audience target form casual to pro gamersImmersiveGreat story (so far I will add)Great writingLoads of ways and methods to do things like earning moneyAmazing level/environment designAnd moreCons:missing featuresRepetitiveYou have to charge constantly ( you'd think advanced spaceships would have a more durable batteries)sentient aliens just stand around would be call if they moved from a immersive point of view single player only (this was what everybody was moaning about)awkward flight controls (basic but not the best. You get used to it)lack of a tutorial (you get around it but there is moment of what am I doing?)Note for everybody reading this I did follow all the hype during this games development. I was even thinking about buying a playstation (xbox fan). However after the release and all the negativity from friends and reviewers I gave it a miss. From what I remember the negativity came from a lack of features in the game that were promoted in the development stage. It go's to say there's still a lack of some features, but I write this hoping I can help bring this game back from the brink because it doesn't deserve to be there honestly.This game has me hooked. I haven't played as much as some people currently but I have played hours straight and quite easily would have played all night and I don't really do that.The dev team have in my mind have done wrong to customers, but they continue with this game because they care and want it to succeed and I think its going in the right direction. They were very likely pushed on time limits from Sony who funded them. However this game was kind of miss advertised in my mind and people weren't in the wrong for being angry with hello games. But please don't punish the game.This game reminds me of spore's space stage but on a grander scale and much more to do. I really get the sense I've only scratched the surface. There is so much to do and see I feel I'm becoming addicted a feeling I haven't felt with a game for a very long time. I just can't wait to see what I find next.I thought the story would bore me and in a game like this it would be linear and basic. But it really is quite engaging and interesting. It improves the experience for me and its not in the slightest compulsory.I feel so immersed in the game from the soundtrack and effects noises to the lifeforms I find scattered across countless stars. There has not been a game in a while that manages to send chills down my spine. Like the first time you fly to a space station and the music kicks in. If you have watched Interstellar and had those chills but this is Like a kickass version with guitar melodies. The thought of the size of the game will give you chills. When you open up the galaxy map and browse throught the stars you will realise how pathetically small you are as an star traveling entity.It has to be said that I don't really play in the whole starship space RPG genre and I think if you are you will enjoy this game but it probably isn't as in-depth control and mechanic wise as you're elite dangerous or star citizen ( note I haven't played either) but I think that might be the right observation for those gamers.There are missing features but I feel its easy for me to move passed them because this game fell off my radar for so long and now I'm experiencing the game for what it is a hugely ambitious and endless game. I've in away not been deterred by the anti hype of the initial release and I think that's why I like it. But that's not to say someone who revisits the game could not get a kick out of this game now and realize the game for what it is ( a great game). When it comes down to it everybody is annoyed because this game could have been better. I've said that already I know.ConclusionThere is definitely need for improvement and I sense that it will come in time. However this is still a fun game for all types of gamers casual and pro alike. Its engaging and immersive and there is a lot to do and find. The story works and draws me which not every game can do. I wasn't expecting that. It is still a hugely ambitious game that took a lot of hard work to produce. My verdict is if you still feel unsure don't buy it at least not yet, but if you are like me and can relate to what I've said go for it. I got it for 20 pounds and I think that is acceptable. I wouldn't buy this full price, but I would suggest waiting for a good steam sale 50% or more off.  8/10 for now.I hope this helps I'm certain there's more to say but I'm eager to get back into no man's sky."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 12, 2016              If you have followed the controversy around No Mans Sky, there is really nothing more to be said about this game. The developers of this game greatly overpromised and underdelivered. Their lying about the games' features is bordering false advertising. If you want to try this game out yourself, beware of the 2 hour refund policy that Steam strictly enforces.If you have NOT followed the controversy around No Mans Sky, here is a summary in bullet points:Good:* There are some great opportunities to make desktop background screenshots in this game. The colors and landscape can look very nice.* Its easy. You will almost never have to worry about stress in this game. It can be a relaxing experience.* The first few hours. The first couple of hours really build a sense of wonder and mystery, making you want to go out there and explore stuff. You might say  oooh  and  aaah  a couple of times. * If you like collecting stuff, you will enjoy running around a planet trying to find all ten different animals, or finding all planets in a solar system.Bad:* You will probably encounter performance issues. The game is horribly optimized. It does NOT look or run as well as the promotional material on the store page.* The actual gameplay is very repetitive. Most of your game time is spent aimlessly wandering or flying in search of minerals.* There is no real diversity. Every planet is more or less the same, but with a different color palette. The planets have no different biomes. North pole, south pole, equator, everything is the same. There are no oceans, great landmasses or mountains, just small pools and hills spread out over the entire planet.* Dull crafting and upgrading mechanics. You wander around shooting a mining laser at minerals, just so you can upgrade your mining laser, so it collects the minerals 10% faster. * No real danger. Your ship is auto-piloted so its impossible to crash. Enemies are not really a challenge without any upgrades, and with some weapon upgrades they become absolutely trivial.* Did I mention there is no real diversity? Animals you encounter are randomly put together from a pool of like 20 parts. The same goes for the spaceships. Space stations all look the same, and are basically abandoned except for one npc who just stands there. There are about 3 different buildings, with hardly anything in them.* Spaceship stuff is lacking. There is hardly any space combat.* No multiplayer. You are alone in this universe, there are no players to encounter.All of this combined is immersion breaking and just plain BORING. You just dont feel like an explorer. All the billions of planets they promised are less interesting than a single chunk of a minecraft world. There is nothing to do. After youve seen the 20 ship parts, 20 animal parts, 3 different buildings and five different planet colors there is nothing to see either.I give this game a 3/10. Its a pre-alpha early access tech demo for a AAA price."

I played it for 30hrs or so hoping that something good was going to happen, that all my hard work was actually going to count for something. I really wanted to like this game. I suppose that in some ways I do, but the idea that I go from planet to planet doing exactly the same things and meeting exactly the same types of aliens just does not appeal to me. The trailer is playing as I write this and I am explaining to my son why I am writing  a negative review by using the trailer as the benchmark for the game. This looked like the kind of game that I did not realise that I had been waiting for. Can you imagine the love for this game if we had not been misled. I would not have cared if anyone else liked it or not. But alas it turned out to be an expensive mistake that  looked good in videos but never lived up to it's promise, not even a little bit. Kind of like the  Paul Pogba of video games .Can this be called fraud and why is it still at full price?Developers have gone under for less with far better games!Why can't I get a refund if this was sold to me based on a lie? Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action . I have over 100 games and this is the first review I've ever done.Do not buy this game at this price!!I bet a lot of the people who gave this a  positive  review no longer play this game!"

The only  online  thing about No Man's Sky is the globalness of the discovery features.  Beyond that, there is no direct P2P interaction to be had here, and therefore this game is entirely single player.  Unfortunately, it is very disatisfying to play No Man's Sky after having confirmed that multiplayer is truly non existant.  If anyone happens to stumble upon my review, I found a planet that had abundant high dollar resources that I could have continued to farm for my entire No Man's Sky career (vortex cubes and a type of green pearl).  I could have stayed on that planet and made endless money - but for what? A nice ship? Who gets to enjoy it but me?  You see, this game is not what it promised.  After 25 hours I do not recommend this game."

Recent game patches have not helped or resolved the crashing issue. Additionally, this game is NOT AT ALL what was described or is described either by Steam/Valve, or the developers Hello Games. It is a bait and switch, nickle and dimed, straight up lie. 90% of the features promised and content promised, even so recent as a month before the release of the game, are NOT IN THE GAME.Literally all you can do is: Fly to one planet, land, pickup resources, fly to another plant, land, pick up resources, sell some resources, continue flying to other planets... you get the idea. It's a  pretty planet simulator , none of this  Do anything at all  crap, and DEFINITELY not what they said it would be like. For example, we were promised things would be dynamic (planets moving, freighter ships moving, you could join  factions  etc), none of that is true. Everything is static, nothing moves, you can't join factions, there is no REAL trading system, etc. Pure trash. Also, these issues don't become apparent until well into the game, past the 2 hour refund limit (which is ridiculously arbitrary to impose on EVERY game, when all games are different. This one for example, takes more than 2 hours to just get past the  training  portion of the game)."

Basically, the player farms resources (while being interrupted and attacked by the same 3 enemy types), drop them off at NPCs, move to the next planet, rinse and repeat. There is nothing at the end of the game, it simply resets.The game might be priced at $60 due to the long development duration and the R&D that went into the procedural generation, but what matters to the player is entertainment, and this game lacks plenty of that."

That said there are glimpses fo what coudl have been and still might be.HOWEVER - unless there are major FREE content updates this game as it stands now is NOT worth anywhere near $60.If you absolutely MUST have this game, do yourself a HUGE favor and wait for a 75% Off Steam Sale - it's coming far sooner than you'd think.-------UPDATE - Came in to check out the update to see if the game is now what was originally promised. Nope, still a boring grindfest that still falls well short of what was promised.  A polished turd is still a turd./uninstall"

So... in short, wait. IF, they add content and gameplay, especially the content that it was promised, it might become an ok game. But I can not recommend it at the full AAA price. It simply is not worth it. The current stability issues compound the situation. Essentially, it feels like a Peter Molyneux game in that it does a small fraction of what you wanted it to, but, at the same time is really kind of boring. This does have potential, and it might be a really cool game, add in a basic mapping utility, some Elite style gameplay and continue to update the engine with skins and textures for map and ship variability, while not charging earlier customers anything more, then fine, I'll recommend it then."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 22, 2016              Hi to all you  No Mensies , copy paste aliens and other unknown jumping weird blob creatures. (More about the blob creatures later...)Firstly i would like to make clear that i fancy all kinds of space scifi like Star Wars, Mass Effect, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Lexx, etc and i had missplaced high hopes for this games gameplay. It is true that there is unfathomable amount of planets to explore 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets to be precise and this does not include space stations, space anomalies, black holes and aswell the mystery in the middle of the galaxy.... But this incredible 18 quintillion number could be the major flaw and downfall of this game.The next segment i'm going to speak might be little bit unfair since the brands and IP:s i mentioned above are allready legendary series and are well estabilished in millions of peoples hearts and minds.Let me make this little bit clearer for example when i think of Star Wars there is certain things that make the SW-universe living and breathing to me like mysteries of The Force, amazing weaponry including the most famous fantasy hand held weapon Lightsaber and fantastic vistas like the tech city of Coruscant or paradise of Alderaan. Most importantly there are characters you care like Ben Kenobi, Han Solo and my personal icon and hero Luke Skywalker.And from here we get to the main issue in the current game  Quantity over Quality . I don't care at all about the alien races since they are pretty much copy paste of each other with few defining factors. Yes they talk differently, have different looks and have different motivations like the Gek like trading and money while Vykeen's are war like race, BUT in the main scheem of things (in my current 49h+ played time) it does not matter at all what race you talk to and how you treat them. They either give you rewards or not, but thats it. They don't getâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off you say them to F***K off or they won't revere you in anyway even though you have treated them like Jeesus himself.Planets and creatures seem to also be very copy pasted. I swear iv'e been so many barren planets that it's not even funny and i have seen way too many jumping blob creatures without legs with few variations. It's amazing that the game thinks that i have found a new creature when i've seen the same freaking stupid things in different planet with slightly different meshes. Where the hell are all the cool dinosaurs and mountain sized snakes?Space stations have been absoultely the same in every system i have visited with maybe different race, but as i previously said they are the same with different skins... Sucks... Couldn't there be atleast like minigames in the cantina or something?Spaceships... Or should i call them spaceholder graphics for your interplanetary van. I might be repeating myself, but same problem arrises with the spaceships that they are basicaly just skins over inventory that you can fly. There is slight differece how you see outside from the inside of the spaceship and texture aesthetics are definetly different between fighters, science vessels, dropships, etc... BUT once again it does not matter if you choose Sputnik look-alike science vessel or x-wing looking fighter since you can build any spaceship mod to any spaceship and make them anything wich makes the categorization of ships to different classes absolutely pointless. The most important thing is that you get the inventory space to the max 48 slots.Pros:- Finding stuff.- You get to name your own findings.- Massive over 100h+ game.- Future promise (Hoping for CO-OP)Cons:- The entire invetory system wich is amazingly stupid and weird... You can stack lets say 250 iron ATOMS to one slot inside of your inventory wich you can use to make stuff... But what the hell! Am i really supposed to believe i can make a freaking thing with so few atoms since a SINGLE human cell has 100 trillion atoms... Now think about a single power cell. -.-- No autosorting of anykind in inventory,- Stacking of items seems to be buging the hell out.- Stupidâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥cursor that you need to wait for anything to happen when you click something. (Had to MOD this to make it instant)- Save system that is definetly not ment for PC.- No wingmen, companions or minions.- You can't use your spaceship to mine planetary surfaces even though a sinlge shot from your rapid firing photon torpedos can obliterate meteors. (the weapons don't do ANY damage to anything on planet surface)- Extremly anoying autosteering sytem with spaceships.- Can't get any larger than fighter craft, no destroyers or battleships.- Space Battles seem to be pointless and should be avoided.- Non living and breathing galaxy.- Language system that i feel is pointless and is just made to make the game longer.- Main Story wich you loose interest fast.- Extremly grindy.- Copy/Paste stuff.- Gameplay feels amazingly primitive and shallow like almost something early 2000s.- Graphics... And no i'm not talking about the graphic style, but acctual graphics.Final Words:This should be a perfect example what happens when the hype train goes full speed and nobody is steering it. The game showed promise and the game could evolve to something great, but at in its current state it is definetly not wort the 60â¬ mark. [EDIT IM NOT COMING BACK AFTER LEARINGING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE! F***K THIS GAME, F***K SEAN AND F***K HELLO GAMES] STILL after all the cons i find myself coming back to the game and having decently fine time until i get bored. I'd advice anyone interested on this game to wait atlest for the next great steam holiday sales. When you see this game with a -50% or -75% than i'd suggest you to try it out.Final Score:I'll give this game  perfect  score of 4 out 10 Space Anomalies."

I realised how pointless it all was and just skipped to the centere of the galaxy to see what amazing things were there, lets just say I was very disapointed."

I do not think this was ever a 60$ title. I got bored 15 hours in and went online to find the ending.

Or the other way around, 80% of the things shown in the trailer wont happen in your first 30h of gameplay. Cant state for myself if they will never happen as the game is random in its core, though.For whats really in the game, it may be worth 10â¬ to get you some chilling hours and some (very little) interesting background storys about alien races.I hope it gets better some day, so they at least made something out of my money."

The only way to earn respect now is to release a whole new (same game) with everything that was promised and more. Do not buy in its current state unless the price is 15$,. We the purchasers have been given a lie, a fully gutted, rush to release date lie. The game was gutted or to make release date possible, or we have been utterly lied too, not 1 of the things that was ever spoken about in interviews and panels, and events like E3 are true. No giant sandworms, no giant creatures, no creatures rustling through the trees roaring at you. No variation in planets, no variation in rare elements, nor are they rare.... No minecraft like building system, where the players make stuff on there own by trial and error. No naming ships, there's about 20-30 different ship models thats it.... for infinite possibilities that's pretty low. Same with planets, at tops 20-30, and that's probably generous.The game was gutted. Or we were lied to simple as that, and still no answers as to why. Maybe they are rolling in cash? Maybe they are rolling in cash in their safehouses scared to publicly apologize for lieing. Who knows. I really hope, and still think its too early, but i really hope they fix their mistakes. The game is garbage. It was fun till I got to the center and got sent to a new galaxy with everything broken, and almost dieing while initializing because i was spawned on a Danagerous sentinel planet. Really dumb design if you can die or almost die while waiting for the game to let you move around. Just untested, gutted, pile of poop. Yes I have lots of hours because i had to check everything, and its nothing."

The game is an empty shell, with next to nothing to look forward to. At this point, after keeping track of your twitter which has been next to dormant ever since release.

It reminds me most of X-Rebirth - explicitly targeting child mentality with the way it does things and how it approaches things. Maybe the Korvax are secretly screaming  SHOW ME YOUR WARES!..... SHOW ME YOUR SKILLS!..... Wanted to like this thing from the beginning. Impossible. Gave Foundation a true chance and explored it as extensively as I could manage.It's so horrendous for me at this point I can't even stand the core game play long enough to reach whatever was actually added by 1.3It's just a piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥----------------------------------Updated for Foundation:For me the foundation update wound up reinforcing just how trulyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥filled the entire NMS game flow design really is.Everything - every single thing you can do - is intentionally artificially sloooooowed down. Right. That's by design and was like that on release.I hadn't touched this thing for months. Went back in hoping to see if they did any real, serious changes. No. No they definitely didn't do any of that from what I can see. They planted their turd-flag.The whole update floats on top of a pathetic, superficial existence that we all experienced from  playing  the release version when the thing came out. We basically got to see, directly, just how trivial things really are because they rushed it out so they could later decide wtf to add they could call  content  I guess.So now with what they're calling  content  - it's just a bunch of window dressing - fragile ornaments hanging off this extremely weak-walled game. They're depending on their core design to hold it up like pillars, and it fails miserably.It didn't add depth - it simply made it even more clear just how god damn horrific the underpinnings of the game really are. How? Why? Because now it depends even more, not less, on the few repetitive actions you can do / have to do, over and over and over and over.... and over... and over.. and they're not fun things to do. None of them. At all.Time to delete, again. Guess many of us really did flush our cash right down a toilet, and we'll probably do so again plenty, but not with these developers.----------------------------------Original review:At the moment there is NO way this game can be recommended with a straight face.Very early on you'll have a bit of fun learning and doing things you haven't done yet.You'll quickly realize - oh, right, that's it. That's all there actually is. Just the same extremely limited number of things to repeat until the sun burns out or you just stop playing.Among many aspects that are extremely tedious and annoying, just to describe one it seems clear they intentionally designed the inventory systems to try and force the player to repeat the limited things to do over and over as much as possible - probably because there's nothing else to do.There are enough people that very badly want to enjoy the game so much they immediately jumped into making mods to try and sort out some of the dipâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥design decisions made by the developers.So - several aspects (flying behavior, inventory and a slew of others) can be changed to remove them from the list of tedious crap, which is great and extremely helpful.Of course the problem remains - there's still nothing actually interesting to do after you've done them x times.There will plenty who are stubborn trying to squeeze some kind of extended fun out of the $60 thrown at Sony... I mean HG.Most will probably just get fed up, cuss the screen, the game, the developers, rage quit, delete the game and move on saying it's yet another lesson learned.Ideally the quality and content lessons need to be learned by the developers and publishers, not the gamers. But since there's such a severe lack of actual quality available we keep jumping and hoping the next will be different.Not yet.If HG wants to fix this shallow piece ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥they definitely can. They could add real, extremely significant amounts of compelling content. Will they? No idea, but if they do and it works people will change their opinion based on real reasons.For now - the negative reviews in general are absolutely warranted.Avoid until they make it fun or it's $5 sitting in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥bucket sale category."

The studios many months of silence following release led us to belive that the game had been abandoned.Then the foundations update was released. Which added a host of interesting new features to the game. At the time I said that if we got 3 more updates as big as this one we would have if not a game worthy of its origional hype, a game worth what we paid for.As of the new 1.3 (Atlas Riases) update I believe they are well on track. They still have a ways to go, but I think if they continue down this path they will have will have earned back at least a modicum of our trust."

Completed and had seen basically everything after 10-15 hours. Played another 10 hours hoping to find something new. Found nothing. No one found anything new.I'll consider coming back when they add actual content to the game. Until then, I can't recommend anyone paying a premium price for a game that is at best in Beta. This game should've launched for $30-40 in Early Access mode.*EDIT* Spent another 15 hours idling in a building on an extreme planet to get achievements. If you die or leave the planet, the counter starts all over from zero. Absolutely horrible experience."

What i like with this game is the look and feel of it. Its not a space simulator, Its more of an Sci-Fi exploration game so instead of wasting time figure out how and where to land, Just land and enjoy finding new things. The BAD thing about this game is that its neverending, but the GOOD thing is that it is. I dont really have any negative things to say. Maybe that i want more variety of fauna, flora and biomes, but there is a massive update coming soon called NEXT that may update this. I also hope they with new future updates keep the NMS univurse big and not shrink it just to please the players who wants to meet up. Its Space. Its suppose to take time getting anywhere. Otherwise, we would as well been playing in a shoebox."

I liked it at launch, but it's not something i would recommend to anyone. Now, it has become a much more fleshed out game with even multiplayer, making the experience all the more better. If you're looking for a cool sci-fi themed game, do get it."

The differences between these  planets  and  moons  is close to non-existant. Those preview videos are a horrible misrepresentation.Basically, this  game  is about flying to various balls of procedurally-generating terrain. The procedural-generation will  magically  transpire before your very eyes, as entire mountains pop-in to existence out of thin air, directly in front of you.Gameplay? Shoot rocks. Why? Because... because. Because there is nothing else to do in this game.Occasionally the game will render a nice scene... nothing like the preview videos will lead you to believe. I'm being VERY kind with this review. The truth is, this game is a fraud on a massive scale. And the worst part is it isn't even a game. There is NO gameplay. It's about  exploration . But it's terrible exploration. It's 100% predictable. Every planet will have these same buildings. Every planet will have these same Zinc plants. Every planet will have these same flying robot-eyes. Every. Planet. Do not expect to find the  diamond in the rough  with this game. Look at actual gameplay from actual people. See how  amazing  this game can be. It's dull. It's dull and boring. That is all this  game  is.I want a refund, so badly. Out of principle. This was fraudulent advertising, and I hope Hello Games pays repercussions.edit: I wrote my review a week after solid playing, upon the game's release. I then quit. Well over a year later, I decided to reinstall it on a whim. To what little is left of the developer's credit, I will applaud their efforts to provide free patched-in content to expand what was an extremely dull experience. As it stands now, one could at least credit this game as being a decent single-player space-survival. It still has a lot of flaws, including the lack of actual purpose beyond flying around procedural-terrain ad infinitum. Survival isn't a challenge. There is no actual goal at the  end  of the plot except to just keep going. But to where? Finding crafting recipes, building bases, etc. But it ultimately leads you to the same place: a near-infinitely wide terrain-generator. Interesting, but ultimately the game's only true end is when it beats you via boredom."

The game feels like an Early Access Game that was released with only 70% of the content complete. I hope that future updates add more to the game, specifically an interesting reason to keep going, but my hopes are not high. Otherwise, this will be just another $60 mistake.Edit after Atlas Rises update: So they added a bunch of crap to the game and some people are over the moon (no pun tintended) and singing the praises. Well, I did not have the same experience as those people. Within the first 3 sessions of playing, I encountered multiple bugs, some game breaking that required a new load. It all came back to me as I played that this just isn't fun. Its a damn inventory management game with a space screensaver skin. In addition, being attacked by ships before you have even been able to upgrade your ship and then having to go get your 'grave' items only to have the same ships kill you again is NOT FUN. THIS GAME IS NOT FUN. At this point, they could have 1 million new updates with all sorts ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but a pig in a dress is still a pig. No thank you."

But while everyone was refunding theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of this game i still had hope. Let's get something out of the way real quick: this game is nowhere near perfect yet. Emphasis on the  yet ; But after the updates that Hello Games have released i'm sure this game will be amazing eventually.Hello Games have made COLOSSAL mistakes while marketing this game.1. They advertised and priced it as a AAA game, while they should have gone the Early Access route.2. They made trailers showing features that were only possible if you got Lottery winner level lucky.3. They went completely radio silent after release.I haven't played this game since the Foundation update released, and i can directly compare the base game and the Pathfinder update game.Here's my thesis: I downloaded the update. For the sake of a clean slate i decided to start a new game. Immediately i noticed some positive diffrences. I have been thrown on a very green planet, which were â¥â¥â¥â¥ing impossible to find in the base game, but let's assume i got lucky. In the next system i found another beautiful green planet with amazing rock formations, tons of trees and interesting fauna, which was surprising. Also, the UI was more responsive and had more quality of life features, the space stations were more populated, and i've had more encounters with freighters and pirates than i've ever had before. Some of which were really cinematic and awesome looking. I might be wrong, but i think HG are doing a lot more in updates than they say they do.Long story short, i think this game is going in the right direction. It will never compete with the ultra realistic Star Citizen, for me it will always be a chill exploration game like Minecraft.Thank you Hello Games for not giving up, it just shows that you guys have balls of steel.P.S: I find it hillarious that under every NMS update video there's people who bash the game for still existing, saying  you'll never be good, just end it . Keep at it Hello Games, and you'll do great things."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 25, 2017              Boy this is a hard game to rate. After careful consideration I'm sad to be going with a No recommendation. So let's get the negative things out of the way first... Main thing for me is, this game just doesn't treat you to a decent early enjoyable experience. It can be a real grind early on forcing you to laboriously mine for elements that are frequently so far away from your ship that the journey there and back is impossibly difficult to achieve before your exosuit's hazard protection runs out. There's barely enough time to look around and enjoy the view or the creatures. We are talking about your first hours with the game here: a time when a well-designed game should be drowning you in its WOW! factor! You should be staying up late, going into work late, annoying your wife/husband/boyfriend/girlfriend/pet with lack of attention. But that won't be happening with this game. Don't get me wrong: You WILL come back to it, but that will be more driven by frustration and a feeling that YOU must have done something wrong, that YOU just don't 'get' the game.Early inventory management is just a chore: I know there's a balance to be struck here, but once something becomes a chore that'a bad sign. It's reminds me of the resource micromanagement chores that are/were so common in simulator games. I just should not have to continually move mined reources etc from exosuit to spaceship; there needs to be a way to do that automtically. Remember I'm supposed to be having FUN with this game!Alien interaction SHOULD be enthralling but here it is incredibly static and frustrating, relying on oddly-stilted captions that have no relationship to the alien's rather poorly implemented facial expressions. And yes, I said facial expressions because of course they talk in gobbeldy-â¥â¥â¥â¥ and you'll have to devote hours just to understand/translate a few words of language (and there are 3 languages. Or 4 maybe?). Like I said, this part of the game, actually interacting with aliens, should have been really thrilling, something to look forward to after the tedium of searching planets for resources all on your lonesome. Instead it feels tacked-on, simply a mechanism to provide a way for you to buy/sell and get missions.Another bothersome thing is that after discovering various waypoints, bases, places of interest, crashed ships etc there is seemingly no way to go back and revisit them. I discovered a Portal, was told to go off and find some glyphs to 'power' the portal (not sure of the terminology here), but after getting lost during the glyph search I was not ever able to find the Portal again. There was no 'pin' to find it. That's just plain annoying. More than that, It's unforgivably poor game design for a discovery game like this.Alright that was a some negative stuff. So let's turn to positives. The planet-side eye-candy is terrific. Fascinating variety of flora and fauna, and strangely enough it doesn't feel so much of a grind to scan/catalog them. Helps that you'll earn currency for doing it. Inter-planetary flight is cool. I got a kick from it every time, though the asteroid belts get annoying but do come in useful for mining some elements while 'in-flight'. There's also hyperdrive flight but I didn't get that far as gathering the resources to create and power it is...well I've already used the word 'grind' and whoops there it is again.In the end, I'm actually sad I couldn't recommend this game. I really wanted to like it! But at its current price it's up thre with AAA games and it just doesn't deliver the quality of experience I expect of an AAA game."

I want(ed) to love this game so badly, and I constantly feel like I'm on the edge of doing so, but I can never quite get there.  The scenery can be great, but it's far from seamless or immersive.  The exploration can be engaging, until you start questioning the point of it when you keep finding the same blueprints 20-30 sites in a row.  The combat seems exciting, until you realize every pirate has two or three friends, and can destroy you with a fart.  I wish I could love this game, but I also wish I only had 10hrs logged so I could return it.  One can live with the graphical hitches & occasional CTD, but unless future (FREE!) patches improve gameplay, buyer beware."

There is not much to do than endlesly explore the world of bugs&glitches that most possibly cannot be solved because of the procedural generation.In a more described content I would highlight that this game had a great marketing campaing that made us explore till the galaxy core and pass our 2hour limit so we wont be able to refund after we realise what is actually going on. I personally believed that the fact that they said no man's sky is a multy-player game is the beging of the lies that completly broke the trust between the people and Hello games. Watching this turn of events it makes me wonder, is this the only lie that the game served us or is it just the  breakfast  of what we are going to see. After 35 hours of game I issued a refund Which I dont think I will ever receive and that breaks my hurt cause I see a company that I value, steam, taking the side of this company that missleaded people on buying an expensive game with 40% of the features that they promised to have. Even if people doesnt get their refunds, Hello-games is becoming Bye-ByeGames cause they lost their credibility to the gamers.  If Bye-ByeGames try to release a new game I believe it will be really interesting to see how they going to work it out. Anyway, untill new updates come with some real content this time I will not touch the game and I will issue a refund til they stop anwsering to every single refund for  No mans sky. I feel missleaded and missguided by any means and I blame HelloGames for all this."

I have always loved the game ever since it was released in August 2016.The first few upated were great but the 1.3 is just awsome!!!I'm playing on an 880m gfx card and cant get good fps and need to play in a window mode.  This isnt ideal but it seems stable for me and with 80 hours of play time put into the game, i just know with this update its going to double.So should you get this game.....if you like to explore, its a must buy.Well done Hello Games, i'm looking forward to seeing whats next."

Perhaps this is a sign that, yes, it was released far too early, or it should have released into Early Access, and it's not going to change the fact of a 1.0 release that's universally referred to with terms like  debacle. But this isn't a review of 1.0; it's a review of 1.3, in which, by the way, you can now build colonies and buy capital ships and employ aliens and drive hoverbikes and oh my god so much more.1.3 is Hello Games' redemption."

Everything on the videos looked awesome about this game. It is NOT awesome. I tried to get a refund. If you play over 2 hours... you're screwed. READ THE REVIEWS... ALL OF THEM... BEFORE PARTING WITH $60!!__________________________________________________________________Never have I been more dissapointed than with this game. The build up and hype by critics and beta testers... ALL OF THEM had to be on the Hello Games payroll, becasue this game, is awful.The game Elite Dangerous by Frontier.... is WAY more in depth and has FAR more options.Graphics? A joke. Different planets... same rocks and plants with different colors.Total waste of money. Wait until it hits the steam store for $5.99"

The game is expansive I'll give it that - after the sheer size of the sandbox you can play in, not much else is appealing. Glitchy graphics, bugs, slow response on a system definitely able to handle the requirements have made this a definite disappointment."

It rasies! It lowers!  It does not effect your gameplay!After upgraded multi-tool, nothing is a challenge anymore.Game is worth $20-30 at most.  $60 is highway robbery.Too late for my refund, take this as fair warning."

I wouldn't pay over $10 for this game.Came back for basbuilding. very soon i found myself asking, well myself, Why am I playing this game again? Whos going to see my base or even care? Not an NPC thats for sure they cant even get out of their ships. A year later and they cant get out of their ships or walk around, Its the same thing with a clever update tag. I will never buy a hello games game ever again. EVER! Do you hear that Hello Games? No you don't because you arn't listening to what people want. You say you do but honestly your company is still the same company that feed us lies. MORE THAN ONCE! Check back in another year to check on this game. Fiy if you do, it will be the same game. I just pulled the  about game  Detials for this game from the store page. lets look at the list of lies this company still spreads.  In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Lies, nothing in no mans sky orbits anything. just static in space. Second, other than some animal life theres not much life. You can go anywhere you choose thou. you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before maybe true but everything looks so close to being the same thing. a speach stone looks like a speech stone, no matter what planet or space. Same goes for every object / base / outpost. At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos.  Watch someone get to the center on youtube, they will beâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and prolly say this is a lie. when you get there theres no cutsence or anything. *spoiler********* You just start over with everything you have broken. what did i learn? Not to trust your company. thanks.2016:trash. after 10 hours you have seen everything. We were shown a game that wasn't the real thing. watch the trailers for all of those who have played so far. Its fun and great for about 10 hours. Ive put 25 into it on pc and 10 on ps4 and i feel like ive seen almost everything in the game. * spoilers *if you get to center of galazy it starts over. lame i want a refund now."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 27, 2016              So after long anticipation for this game, I can safely say I am sorely disappointed in the product I paid for, and for a number of reasons. I've put 17 hours into this game so far. I wanted to give it a solid chance, like I do with most games I purchase. I played it solid for about 8 hours after exploring 2 planets, and came to realise that the game was just a repetitive grindfest/time sink: go to planet A, scan for objective B, collect material C, document flora/fauna D, rinse repeat until you decide to turn it off and play something else. I came back to it a day or two later to put another 5 hours into it just to give another chance, and found that the next 3 planets I hopped to were just as boring. I did the same again for the next revisit of my playtime, to which I have come to the conclusion that I do not foresee myself playing the game again.On launch, the game ran fine. Running at 144 frames on a 144hz monitor, with a 4790k, 16GB RAM, and a 980Ti, it was smooth as butter. My only gripe with the UI from launch, was the constant annoyances of holding a button to do this that or the other, and the sound bugs and alerts of your suit being low at 75%.. Following the recent updates, this game just does not run well at all, 30/40fps with it on low, or high, with every type of AA tested.Couple the above with it being nothing at all what the media and teasers had hyped it up to be, I was even more disappointed with this game, having followed it closely for 2 years since learning of its development. I'm not even going to mention the whole deal with the supposed multiplayer aspect either.Would I recommend this game? Not at all, possibly if it comes down in price to say Â£15, and then goes on sale? Sure."

Pick it up when it is heavily discounted, or part of a bundle.Gameplay is extremely shallow, two dimensional, and repetitive. Attempt at a story within the game is childish at best. Many of the games mechanics are blatantly designed as a time sink without having any other purpose, grinding for grindings sake. After the initial  Wow!  factor wears off, and you depart the planet you start on, the workings of the  magick trick  are laid bare in front of you. It left me feeling let down.Imagine yourself walking in to what appears to be a spacious and well decorated room, seemingly containing an endless supply of curios, knick knacks, and other interesting objects. As you begin to satisfy your curiosity by examining the room and it's items you realize that it's not a room at all, but a fairly narrow hallway lined with mirrors. Suddenly the selection of items at your purview are quite finite, and after you examine the ones within your reach you press on to look at the ones further ahead. After a small amount of time passes you begin to realize that the objects are starting to repeat themselves, with only the slightest variations, and you decide to simply press on and see at least where this hallway leads. After all, you were told there is a door at the end of it that will lead you elsewhere. This hallway turns out to be a whole lot longer than you anticipated, and by the time you are nearing the door you have stopped even noticing the small amount of decor around you, simply pushing on as fast as possible intent on finding out what is beyound that door. Wishing for the journey you just undertook to be justified by what lies beyound this door you burst through it with excitement, that you initially experienced upon entering the  room  in the first place, and find yourself...Walking in to what appears to be a spacious and well decorated room, seemingly containing an endless supply of curios, knick knacks, and other interesting objects..."

If you guys think this game looks good based on gameplay footage I would almost guarentee 95% of it is not even in the game , I don't understand how a company can lie so much. There are zero large creatures , zero large flyign space creatures , it's a joke. I have never been so bummed out in my entire life. If I could I would get a refund. You guys are better off waiting for the next civilization or buy the witcher 3 or something good for 60 USD. Way too many fundemental flaws , user interface is terrible. overall it's just a really bad version of Destiny."

No Man's Sky is a  procedurally generated universe  that's about a few climates, some animals that seems like mixing dinosaurs and normal animals, plants, planets full of plutonium and the same borring pathers for the entire game. Your goal is to explore, to travel to any planet you can see in the sky, this is just a complete misoportunity to create a large universe to explore using the same assets over and over again, all npc have the same dialoges of trade, all huts and space station are the exact same, there are no npc outside huts, no civilizations, no space combat, all the ships are the same. NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, and yeah SPOILERS AHEAD: but seriously when you reach the center of the galaxy, the game takes you back to a starter planet and you have to do all over again, this game is honestly a sad depressing misleading bs from Hello Games that completly killed any chance of me buying any game from them ever again, they did and show a lot of promise for example free dlc, which is not going to happend, they lied to the player base and charge full price: 59.99 dollars for a barebone game that hardly cost 20 at this point, honestly the amount of frustration this game gave alongside with the TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE ON MY PC THAT NOT EVEN JUST CAUSE 3 CAN MATCH completly killed my mod to play this game, sadly i cannot refund this game, all i can do is warn you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, FOR ANY PRICE! this game is a lie straight to customers charged full price, missing most featured promesed with serious performance issues, don't be fouled by the positive reviews this game have, they are mostly fanboys thinking they can save the sinking ship Hello Games is, Sean Murray is a liar and to take a team of 15 for a project like this is a joke, hell knowing what this game is i won't take it as a gift.Score: 11/100Plus AngryJoe review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTTPlqK8AnYPlus Honest Game Trailers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wsFhv_Kz38"

Like many others have said the devs did lie about some features but I really gotta give them credit for sticking with the game and not taking the money and running. This game and the devs reputation will always be damaged due to the release. But if they keep updates rolling out with the features promised then perhaps they can earn the trust of many. Lesson to be learned here is to never hop on a hype train...especially when money is involved.As for the game. I recommend it. Absolutely. It does feel repetitive at times. So if you followed this game pre-release and wanted it....get it now while its on sale."

When the game first came out it had over 200,000 players on at one point, now there is a mear 800. If that doesn't prove this game is the biggest scam of 2016 I don't know what does. The devs completely lied about countless features that were meant to be in this game. ________________________________________________________________________________I clearly had very strong feeling about the game after playing for about 40 or so hours, but now that Hello Games have released the new update I decided I needed to revist the game in order to see what sort of improvements were made.Obviously the update doesn't add all the features we were told about before the game was launched, but it does add content that we had all hoped to receive and that's awesome. It shows that Hello Games have started taking a step in the right direction in hopes to fix their game. I really did enjoy the game when it first was released, but did quickly realize how much content was actually not in the game. It's very nice to see the developers going back to try fixing this by adding content many players were excited about.Thoughts about the 1.1 update______________________Game Modes--------------- The additon of game modes is very nice, I think it's a great way to allow different kinds of players to enjoy the game. The three modes areNormal - this is what most players who revisit the game will know, it's basically the same as before 1.1 but with the new content such as base buildingSurvival - Practically the same as normal, but with a very steep learning curve. I personally really loved the challenge, you start in a random location on a planet (from my multiple games I noticed all the planets had some sort of harsh environment), and in order to get your ship you have to gather materials and reach you ship (the ship seemed to be anywhere from 8-15 minutes away from your spawn location)Creative - Much like creative mode in minecraft. You have god mode, and unlimited materials. It's a great mode for building up a base if you want to see what all you can do with it.Base Building__________- The base building is fun and simple. Being able to set up a planet as a  home base  was something I was excited about from the start of the game, it's very simple and I can already tell how useful the bases will actually be. They will not be something you spend time on and then forget about within an hour.- Hiring people from the different races is an interesting way to liven up the bases.- As you hire people to work at your base they will give you missions to go gather materials in order to advance or learn how to make a new building, the  base researches  is a great way to add somwhat of a  questing system .- Within the bases it seems like you have you own personally space stations, which is very nice. No more flying back and forth once you fill up your ship with materials.- Having a teleporter that can transport you from the space station to your base is actually very cool, I always hated having to fly to the space station just to buy some material I couldn't find on the planets easily.Materials_______ - The new materials are interesting, I like the idea of needing to research certain equipment in order to harvest new materials.- Some of the new materials require you to have sort of gauntlet in order to harvest, I think it's great that you now need more than just your multi-tool in order to fully harvest a planet for all of its worth.As I said above I really enjoyed experiencing the new content and found it very simple yet enjoyable. I think it's great to see Hello Games finally make a comeback after letting down so many people, it's obvious they spent a lot of time on the new content in order to make it up to the older players and to make sure they gave quality content to their players.________________________________________________________________________________This is probably the part where I start to get thumbs down because of my review________________________________________________________________________________After revisiting NMS and checking out the newest update I think 99% of the recent reviews on this game should be removed. They are clearly people who hardly tried the game before deciding they wanted to give it a negative review like everyone else. If you read their reviews they can't even tell you want they disliked about the game, how can you give a negative review but not explain what you disliked.I think Hello Games did a great job with the 1.1 update, and I think that most of the negative reviews should be ignored until you get the check out the game yourself."

I was hyped up for it and even after it launched I tried to listen to the positive aspects of it from people who were enjoying it.I figured what I was hearing was good enough for me. Well it took over a dozen hours to realize that most of the promises made during development were not fulfilled. I won't list the reasons here because there are many discussions and threads including the mega-compilation of missing features that can be looked into. The game may be fun for some but truthfully once you've seen a handful of planets you have seen them all.Obviously I do not have any inside information about the development of the game but I cannot understand how the end product is so vastly inferior to demos that were shown 2 or more years ago, unless those demonstrations were outright fake.Since I am not able to receive a refund on this game because of my time played, my only hope is to let it sit in my library and wait for the developer to deliver what they promised at the price I already paid, however I don't see how that is possible short of a re-write of the much of the base functionality. It is my opinion the game was watered down to support the PS4 instead of realizing it's potential on the near-limitless PC platform.Additionally, the game did not perform as well as I expected based on my system specs which far outpace the listed system requirements. It was very playable at first however with only minimal drops below 60 FPS, but it seems the more I played the worse the game performed, and this was across separate sessions of play. Also the performance seemed to get worse with each subsequent patch.My recommendation is not to buy until a major update is made or a deep discount is available."

Sean Murray is basically the new sergey titov (warz now known as Infestation: Survivor Stories and many other half made barren games). He claims there will be all these amazing features and fails to implement them, or just decides to not want them in the game and when asked about it vaguely gives information to why or what happened or flat out lies. From the start i never had high hopes for this game but i never imagined it would be as barren as it was with little or no reason to even play the game. honestly this game is not worth the $60 price tag and it wouldnt be complained about as much if it was priced at $10 which is still too high of a cost for what this game offers."

It is in its essence incomplete even if it is sold as a fully polished game. I was very excited for this game and the procedurally generated worlds but the assets are extremely limited and no matter where you go, you'll start seeing the same stuff over, and over, and over, and over again. The game being only a 2.8GB download, I did not find it surprising and was already worried about this happening. There is no story to speak of and only one task to complete, get to the center of the universe which is in essence an extremely repetitive task of mining and exploring. Without any deeper level of gameplay I find this a very shallow game. Since you can't even play with your friends it makes the game even more unbelievably monotonous.There are a few graphic tricks in the engine on how the world loads in, even with a 4790k @4.7ghz and a 980gtx the load took forever to load in, just made me dizzy most of the time and reminded me I'm in a game instrad of being sucked into a  rich (it's not rich) procedurally generated world.In the end I give this game a 3/10 for its huge untapped potential which is now certainly going to go to waste. Iâm surprised they didnât do more with the time they had available."

Also, *SPOILER*, have the center of the galaxy be a reset button is a giant middle finger to players everywhere. WHOSE idea was that?

I still remember when a friend showed me the videos advertising this game about a year ago, it promised an infite world of possibilities, a game wich would be endless in a sense and complete with a lot of material that would keep you hooked ingame. We recieved NONE of this. Hello Games lied to our faces and then laughed in our faces.A completely evasive and liar Sean Murray presented us a game that promised so much, they had me hooked on the content that was showed in the promotional videos and gameplays up to the day I bought it, it was the moment the illusion cracked and the ugly truth was shown. A poorly optimized game (with years of development), missing content to the extent that they had to put a new sticker covering the promised Multiplayer possibilities on the boxes shipped and so many more content that was shown to us wich is nowhere to be found ingame. After hours of playing, all I could think of was  how could have possibly wasted my money on this game . Repetive mechanics, poorly designed inventory management, awfully optimized game engine (nearly unplayable) and missing content. Lies, lies and more lies. If we have to wait a year to get the promised its saying out loud that they released an incomplete game based on FALSE CONTENT and ADVERTISING.I feel lied to, abused by a company wich took advantage of the false advertising. This game and company are a fraud.I probably wont be able to get my money back, but no one can stop me from writing this. Save yourself the money and the time. DO NOT BUY."

After that was finally done, i ended up breaking the main quest by accident (dont sell any of your atlas stones). after this, i started a new game and decided to mod the crap out of the game so it wouldnt take forever to reach the center of the galaxy.  i finished the main quest and was very disappointed, but i kept hoping beyond hope that my journey would be rewarded at the center of the galaxy. it wasn't. i installed a mod that would basically let me warp to infinity in one jump so i wouldn't have to stop for fuel over and over and waste my life grinding at this goal of the bright, shiny center. and im so glad i did this, because what lies at the center? A BRAND NEW GALAXY! so i can waste my time doing boring, repetitive actions all over again!  i didn't want to spoil the game for myself by looking up what happens when you reach the center, but if i had known what was in store for me  i never would've wasted my money on this game. i tell you this, dear and highly improbable reader, because you may not yet know the pain of spending over 100 hours grinding and grinding to reach that impossibly far off goal, only to have it zoom out dramatically to the edge of the galaxy, effectively invalidating all of the repetitive, mind numbing effort you just put in. it hurts, and i dont want you to know this pain, whoever you are. it's too late for me, but maybe i can spare you and your wallet. heed my advice and do not buy this game, at least until they patch it. as it stands, it is definitely not worth $60."

After a while, the grind got too repetative, and the initial excitement died out. Mods help to bring me back every once and a while, but in the end, the game was built on promises that were never fulfilled. And it is for that reason that I can't recommend this game. Maybe if Hello Games had released a statement, or at least attempted to maintain PR, it wouldn't have been such a colossal failure."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 28, 2016              As you can see by most of the reviews for this game, false advertising is probably the biggest reason for me to dislike the game, besides the lack of content, which was something I feel cheated on. I sincerly feel that we as the community that bought the game hoping for a good experience, were lied to, we should be able to be refunded even if we have 17 + hours in it because we tried to find the good in it. I truely did, and I just couldn't. Especially after waiting through so many delays, they could of at least given us the full promised game.However the base is there now, they need to build up on that, or even the community (yes I mean they should release modding tools at least so if they don't want to make it better, we can).Long story short, this game is not worth $60 US, which is even more considering I had to convert $ AUS to buy it. For what we were promised and shown, not there. And I feel that all of us who did try to give the game the benefit of the doubt should still be able to get a refund even if it has been however long, especialy with the false advertising, not to mention 2 hours of play time was not enough time to fully decide to refund the game, because at that point it was still somewhat a decent game, for what was there."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 5, 2016              Update: I see the reviews have greatly improved on this game and the devs seem to be consistently adding new content, which is a huge improvement in itself.  However, I haven't had the opportunity to play it again but I did nominate the game for the Steam award  Cry Havoc And Let Slip The Dogs Of War  because it has potential and, as far as I know, that's pretty much all it has.  May update in the future.I really had such high hopes for this game.  I've always wanted to be able to travel through the universe and see things that no one will ever even dream of and this was, what I had hoped to be, my closest opportunity to that dream becoming reality.Evidently the devs made this game with the Steam two hour refund window in mind.  Within two hours, I had seen pretty much everything this game had to offer.  All the planets, life, and resources were very generic and had an easily recognizable pattern. I was past the Steam refund time so I decided to keep playing and hope I would find something interesting enough to make me continue to actually want to play it.  It even became a grind to have enough resources to be able to travel to other galaxies, not to mention that, even with largely upgraded slots on my suit and my ship, I was constantly running out of room and almost impossible to find somewhere to sell the junk.TLDR: grindy, not fun for more than a few hours at best, way overhyped, and as many other reviews have stated - promises went unfulfilled.  Part of me regrets buying this game and will probably never buy another game within the first few days of release cause I don't enjoy getting myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥pushed in, and part of me tries to convince myself that a few hours were enjoyable as I cry myself to sleep each night with an empty stomach."

And wait for the price to drop ."

First look of the game before the release had me and many other people really impressed with the scale and creativity of the game. This is by far the worst 60 dollars I have ever spent on a game. This game is based on lies from the developers mouth, screenshots, trailers, and gameplay. Key features of the game do not exist. The sad part is most people including myself played this game over 2 hours to keep digging into what this game was supposed to offer but never found it. Refund lost, thanks steam. It would be completely fine and understandable if the game did have everything promised by the developers, then it would be the customers buying this game at fault. I hope Hello Games is enjoying the money from one of the biggest gaming scams of all time. Meanwhille, Ill never play this game again and wish Hello Games would take those 18 quintillion planets and stick them up their asses."

I bought this game on the day of release and wanted to explore what I thought would be a galaxy of diverse and unique planets, with none of them being exactly the same, that was, after all, what I was promised. Instead I found that a majoruty of the planets seemed oddly similar, and almost all of them had life, but Hello Games had stated that only about 10% of planets would have life, but the numbers seemed to be swapped, with almost every planet having some sort of life, and usually just different body parts replacing what was on the animals from the planet before.I could continue to complain about everything I was promised by the company that they didn't deliver, but it has all been said before. and the promises will still be broken."

Then it came out and the reviews were awful, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and I bought the game because I thought that most of the negative reviews were regarding performance issues; boy was I wrong. There just is not even close to $60 worth of content in this game. I hate paying the $60 price tag for games and this one really screwed me. In the past year and a half I have played more mainstream triple A  games then I have ever played before and this game isn't even in the ballpark adjacent to those games, but yet this game costs $60. I have head the pleasure of playing Fallout 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Halo 5, Forza 6, and Metal Gear Solid V. All of these games had excellent graphics, lots of content, and ran well on their respective platforms. I cannot say the same for No Mans Sky. The content is incredibly sparce for a game with a giant open world. The graphics in this game are not as good as I was expecting and the optimization is poor to say the least.One of the things that most upsets me about this game is the fact that the developers lied about some of the content. A lot of the things pictured in the screenshots are not in the actual game. This game came up as a topic of discussion during a marketing seminar in one of my business classes. The doctor of marketing that was speaking to us described this game as a  perfect example of bad marketing.  She said that there is a good chance that the lawsuit(s) against the developer will be successful. I really can't think of a good reason to buy this game. The content to dollar ratio is terrible and that alone is reason enough not to buy this game. The lies, poor optimization, less than stellar graphics, are just the icing on the cake. Hell, its almost embarassing having this game in my library.  I am not writing this to rant and rave and ask for my $60 back, I just want to express my disapointment in what could have been a really awesome game and I want to discourage others from making the  same mistake that I did."

Great buy at $20Really bad performance and stability issues at launch. Required MUCH high hardware than advertised."

No responses at all. The game lacks content on a scale like no other. Sure, it was a ground breaking idea and the previews were amazing. It's just too bad hardly any promised content was released with the actual game."

Even the Pulse Drives, which as far as I can tell, are supposed to convey a sense of speed, take so much time to get from place to place it's not even funny. What essentially happens in each system is this, with very little divergence:1. go to planet2. look for materials for warp cell, if there are no materials, repeat step 13. make warp cell4. go to new system5. repeatUnless you have nothing better to do besides play this boring mess, don't even think about it.To developer: Hello Games, your project was ambitious, and you tried. I respect that, but please, next time, look to this as an example and try to do better."

Please Steam, I never asked that before, but can you please credit my game, so that I can enjoy other working steam games. Working games, games that fonction correctly. Game that people enjoy. You know people dont enjoy this one. Do something"

As I didnt watch them. trying to keep the game a genuine surprise.What Hello Games have done here is construct a wonderful Engine. Which can generate a beautiful universe for us to explore. Whey they then FOGOT, was to then fill it with ANYTHING to do.I spent 6-7 Hours on the first planet trying to get as much as I could from it. Expecting the next to be different.Only to find the NEXT 6-7 hours to be absolutely identicle to the last.I'm and old school Everquest Fan. So i know all about grinding. Thing is, the EQ grind was more often then not met with success. The hours (days) of waiting/working/camping finally paid off and made the effort all worth while. I feel no reward for time spent on NMS. What I'm hoping is that hello games will now dissappear into their office. work there arses of. and release a massive free patch that adds fricking content. I genuinly believe there is an oppurtunity here for a ground breaking genre changing experience. Maybe 15 people just arent enough to make it happen."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 4, 2016              I would like to make it clear from the outset that I quite enjoyed playing No Man's Sky. Amidst what is currently a developing maelstrom of hatred, there remains at the core a reasonably passable indie game. Something that I could, under different circumstances, have loved. But circumstance unfortunately plays a huge part in the negative review I'm filing. First, the game:No Man's Sky drops you in the middle of a huge (and I mean huge, mind-bogglingly so) procedurally generated universe with an inestimable number of planets. It's highly probable that no two players will ever see the same things, which in itself is an existentially and thematically brilliant concept. As a player, your place and goal in such a huge universe is exploration, hopping from planet to planet digging things up with a laser tool, such as minerals and plant matter, so that you can get to the next star system. You can stop at space stations, trade your minerals with ugly aliens and aim to get a bigger ship with currency that is accumulated through interactions with factions and trading.Unfortunately, it ends there. Whilst there is the whisper of a story to be heard in the vast echoing universe, it remains largely underwhelming. You can decipher alien languages and glimpse their cultures through visiting randomly scattered places of ancient worship / engaging in conversation with living aliens, but this is far from engaging or overly interesting. Also, although there may be quintillions of planets to explore, and equal numbers of animals and fauna to interact with, you start to see similar patterns emerge very quickly. Obviously, these huge numbers include INCREDIBLY similar variations, and in such a vast space, this seems to leave a disappointing taste.Your dreams of being a lone space explorer humming to yourself as you travel at light speed through a beautiful galaxy may well be fulfilled, but when you get to your destination, you get the sense that there are many missed opportunities here for something truly special. The universe is beautiful, but cold and sparse - and not in a mysterious, sexy way, but in a vaguely upsetting way.Then of course we must unfortunately turn to the allegations of false advertising and empty promises put forward by the developers. Whilst I believe that the  hype train  was hijacked too early and strongly by overly zealous publishers and would-be-fans, there does seem to be an air of dishonesty about the way the game has been handled. Multiplayer, story, progression systems and longevity all seem remarkably absent. All of these elements were promised, but not delivered.I think that I would have loved No Man's Sky were it properly sold to me as what it was, at a reasonable price. I would happily have handed over Â£20 for this game to an earnest indie developer. But unfortunately I feel I was somewhat mislead into giving out Â£50 to a developer I felt had struck gold and was about to unleash an industry changer. Perhaps it is my fault for letting the hype take hold, I don't know. Either way, I feel like I've wasted my money.Any game that is given a special notice on Steam about the refund policy applying is surely one best avoided, and unfortunately I agree with this sentiment. Unless the thesis of this game really grabs you, then stay away from it.Hopefully a developer will take some of the concepts theorised here and apply them to something great. Until then, the stars will have to remain untrodden."

I bought this game on the day of release and wanted to explore what I thought would be a galaxy of diverse and unique planets, with none of them being exactly the same, that was, after all, what I was promised. Instead I found that a majoruty of the planets seemed oddly similar, and almost all of them had life, but Hello Games had stated that only about 10% of planets would have life, but the numbers seemed to be swapped, with almost every planet having some sort of life, and usually just different body parts replacing what was on the animals from the planet before.I could continue to complain about everything I was promised by the company that they didn't deliver, but it has all been said before. and the promises will still be broken."

After a while you see similarities in features, animals, etc. There is no real purpose to this game. it is merely a chance to explore. Unfortunately as stated above, the exploration becomes a wee bit repetative. Been there done that, dejavue.The graphics are also on the cartoony side. Probably could not be helped and are more likely a result of the needs of the game engine.Considering the challenges and very mild violence, I would recomend this for the under 10 year old set. older than that and you will be very VERY disappointed."

I ground through this game for a few hours looking for the point, then realized I had played too long to qualify for a refund.

Then it came out and the reviews were awful, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and I bought the game because I thought that most of the negative reviews were regarding performance issues; boy was I wrong. There just is not even close to $60 worth of content in this game. I hate paying the $60 price tag for games and this one really screwed me. In the past year and a half I have played more mainstream triple A  games then I have ever played before and this game isn't even in the ballpark adjacent to those games, but yet this game costs $60. I have head the pleasure of playing Fallout 4, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Halo 5, Forza 6, and Metal Gear Solid V. All of these games had excellent graphics, lots of content, and ran well on their respective platforms. I cannot say the same for No Mans Sky. The content is incredibly sparce for a game with a giant open world. The graphics in this game are not as good as I was expecting and the optimization is poor to say the least.One of the things that most upsets me about this game is the fact that the developers lied about some of the content. A lot of the things pictured in the screenshots are not in the actual game. This game came up as a topic of discussion during a marketing seminar in one of my business classes. The doctor of marketing that was speaking to us described this game as a  perfect example of bad marketing.  She said that there is a good chance that the lawsuit(s) against the developer will be successful. I really can't think of a good reason to buy this game. The content to dollar ratio is terrible and that alone is reason enough not to buy this game. The lies, poor optimization, less than stellar graphics, are just the icing on the cake. Hell, its almost embarassing having this game in my library.  I am not writing this to rant and rave and ask for my $60 back, I just want to express my disapointment in what could have been a really awesome game and I want to discourage others from making the  same mistake that I did."

First look of the game before the release had me and many other people really impressed with the scale and creativity of the game. This is by far the worst 60 dollars I have ever spent on a game. This game is based on lies from the developers mouth, screenshots, trailers, and gameplay. Key features of the game do not exist. The sad part is most people including myself played this game over 2 hours to keep digging into what this game was supposed to offer but never found it. Refund lost, thanks steam. It would be completely fine and understandable if the game did have everything promised by the developers, then it would be the customers buying this game at fault. I hope Hello Games is enjoying the money from one of the biggest gaming scams of all time. Meanwhille, Ill never play this game again and wish Hello Games would take those 18 quintillion planets and stick them up their asses."

The delightfuly vague story and and universe you are thrown into are absurdist in every sense of the word.Wouldn't recommend if you prefer everything to be laid out for you, but I had a blast just wandering through the galaxy in search of the perfect planet/system to move my base to, along with grinding for the perfect freighter and filling it with the coolest ships. Took a couple hundred hours for that to get old and I am still holding my breath for the next update to give me a reason to dive back in.Also, my dream is that they release this in VR some day. This game was practically made for it, and they could benefit from starting with some fresh water instead of only trying to filter the salt out of the ocean."

Sure, they have added some rudimentary multiplayer capabilities (i.e. instanced, up to 4 friends, etc), but that's not what I'm talking about. NMS is a game absolutely designed to be a single-player experience. Any and all multiplayer features that exist or may come to exist are just to improve longevity and replayability. But the single player is THE experience to have. It's a game that pauses everything when you ALT-TAB, even though your discoveries and planets are available for other players to visit; it's a lonely journey of discovery and adventure. Sure, that might not be the game for you, but that is the game it was meant to be and is. If you're looking for an MMO-like experience, skip NMS.If you're looking for a co-op game to play with your buddies, skip NMS.If you're looking for a game where you'll sink a ton of hours into, where you'll experience finding that gem of a procedurally generated planet that you **have** to share on Reddit, a game that translates the feeling of being a tiny spec in the infinity of Universe, of searching for purpose and meaning while developing your skills and acquiring technology and vehicles in RPG-esque way, than NMS is the game for you. The co-op and multiplayer aspect are just added bonus, and very welcome at that. But they were never and will never be the core of the NMS experience. Any one getting into this game for those features will inevitably dislike the game. Any one who gets into this game for the lonely experience and then finds those features will be pleasantly surprised.A quick note about Hello Games: I bought this game at launch, saw the hate and didn't play it for nearly 2 years (post-NEXT). I was afraid the hate would make the developers abandon the game to work on something else new, a clean slate. To my pleasant surprise, they've been at it for over 2 years, with regular releases, decent communication with the community, a bug tracker where anyone can submit bugs, etc. I know it's popular to hate on Sean and Hello Games, but I have nothing but praise. They were pushed into an unfortunate  perfect storm  of a launch, but didn't back away from their vision and goals for the game. They kept at it and have been making the game closer and closer to their original vision. Here's to hoping they keep working on it for years to come. I'd love to have my kids play this when they are old enough to experience it themselves... Kudos and godspeed, folks! o7"

I held off on it until I heard good things about it and i bought it the day the NEXT update came out while it was on sale for $30. The moment I started playing, it caught my attention. Got the game 2 days ago and already have about 23 hours clocked. Some concepts of the game are confusing and not taught, but a quick forums search will help out in that respect. I definitely rcommend this game to anyone looking for a massive sandbox game."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 26, 2016              This game is about exploration. You are drawn into a world with a rich and intrigueing history, and a mystery that pulls you along. As you explore, you find new wonders and new things, made even more wonderful with the knowledge that you are the first to have found it; as the universe is so vast that much of it remains unexplored by anyone else who played the game before you!But after a time, you realize that you've discovered everything. You learn the limits of the procedural generation and everything begins to look the same. What once held mystery becomes much more boring. Exploration is a lot less enjoyable when you know what you'll find at the other end; you no longer explore, and you begin the grind.You travel from planet to planet to find resources that'll help you on your journey, thinking that maybe if you got closer to the center you'll find new things. But after a dozen hours of jumping from black hole to black hole, everything still looks the same. The game becomes apparent for what it is; it's a shell. A big empty husk that that feels unfinished. There is, quite frankly, not much to do. The lack of things to do is obsfucated by the amount of time it takes to do them. But at 40 hours I realized I had nothing to do. This game has a lot of potential, but so far has felt like a waste of time. The big mystery, when you discover it for what it is, is a huge let down. The game is interesting, and has potential. So I'll keep my eye on it for future content updates. But the original release of this game was terrible. Content is severly lacking, and it took forever for them to fix game breaking bugs. At the 44 hour mark I still had severe framerate drops that require a hard reset to fix. This game felt more like an indie game, not a AAA title that would warrant a $60 price tag. Unlike an indie game, the complete silence from the developers along absolutely no word on anything resembling future content really just forces me to walk away from the game and warn others to stay away."

When no mans sky was first announced way back when, it looked too good to be true and it was. After having my heart broken, it would take allot to fix it, but thats exactly what hello games is accomplishing. The game is stunning, it's sense of scale is outstanding! As you travel you get a beautiful feeling of exploration, knowing that the places you go and the situations you find yourself are completely unique to your journey. Playing alongside a few friends did give the game more meaning, I find that people like to leave a mark in life, this translates directly to video games and this is a huge part of no mans sky for me, exploring the unknown and leaving a bit of me behind. I do hope they continue to update this game, focus on more procedural content within the game and try to expand the multiplayer as much as possible. I want 1000's players on a single planet. I love this game, it touched me like no other."

I played it for about 20 hours, but after that it just loses steam... there's simply not much to do. I kept positive, thinking that the devs would continue to support the game and add more stuff as promised. As you can see that hasn't happened as the last patch was almost 8 weeks ago at time of writing.Combat is laughable bad. Enemies cannot miss so there's no point to moving. The same type of enemies attack you on every planet, and they get mad at you for performing the core mechanic of the game (mining, collecting stuff). It's just annoying and adds nothing to the gameplay.Space combat is also laughably bad. It is slow, unwieldy, and feels like you're plinking the other ships with BB guns. Your ship shield will take heavy damage which you have to repair in flight by opening the inventory and combining it which needless to say quickly gets old.And then there's the inventory, which is trash. It wasn't designed for the precision of a mouse so everything must be confirmed by holding the button down. There's no way to directly swap two items, you have to use a third, empty slot. If you don't have an empty slot you're justâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of luck. It's needlessly complex and annoying to deal with.The planets can be neat, but there is only so much variety to be seen before it gets old. Poison planet, Rad planet, Ice planet, Plant planet, and so on. They're all different but only so much so, and are rarely very memorable.Look, I don't have too high standards. If I can get am amusing or novel experience from a game I don't really care how long that experience was, within reason, but this game is just full of broken promises and lost opportunity. If it goes on sale for <30 USD I'd say get it if you're interested in an exploration only game. Otherwise, avoid it."

It's clear to see at this point that the rocky launch was caused by naivety and excitement. I think it right that we leave the past in the past, if you no longer pre-order games: good for you, if you learned to manage your own hype and deal with disappointment: thatâs great as well, if you sent bomb threats and harassed a small group of developers: youâre not reading this and thinking critically about your actions. Now with the multitude of updates that have come out for No Manâs Sky since itâs launch and the wonderful modding community the game can be whatever you want it to be. No Manâs Sky is an amazing piece of art as a game and in the tech, and I must thank Hello Games, Sean, and the rest of the crew for sticking this one out. Thank you so much guys."

When no mans sky was first announced way back when, it looked too good to be true and it was. After having my heart broken, it would take allot to fix it, but thats exactly what hello games is accomplishing. The game is stunning, it's sense of scale is outstanding! As you travel you get a beautiful feeling of exploration, knowing that the places you go and the situations you find yourself are completely unique to your journey. Playing alongside a few friends did give the game more meaning, I find that people like to leave a mark in life, this translates directly to video games and this is a huge part of no mans sky for me, exploring the unknown and leaving a bit of me behind. I do hope they continue to update this game, focus on more procedural content within the game and try to expand the multiplayer as much as possible. I want 1000's players on a single planet. I love this game, it touched me like no other."

With the latest update (NEXT) they have an extremely solid game that should reignite old players and give new players a glimpse at what else might be in store.  With upcoming community events, revamped crafting, and building mechanics I think this is what the developers initially envisioned."

I want to be suprised by it and see a new creature ive never seen before. everything I see is a mixture between a creature I saw 2 planets ago with a head I saw on a creature on another planet 2 systems ago etc. the planets are all so similar as well and after a while you just get bored of exploring. which unfortunately is the most interesting part of the game. for 40 quid its not worth the money and id have to say i do not recommend the game for purchase at the current state."

Once you are bored with the initial game play loop of harvesting resourses to upgrade your ability to gather more resources, there is nothing to do.  Imagine minecraft without the ability to build anything or do anything adventerous like go to the netherworld.  The only thing is to go to another galaxy that's basically just like the one you came from that has planets that are basically just like the ones you already visited.  Unfortunately, you won't realize any of this until you've logged a few too many hours to get a refund. Also, the universe screen where you chose which galaxy to travel to next is the absolute worst interface I've ever had the displeasure to experience in a video game.  It's horrendous."

The devs flat out lied about the game and its content throughout development and up until the game was launched. There is no  game  to speak of, there is no multiplayer, the size and scope of the game has been completely over promised, and it runs like garbage. I wanted to love this game, I still want to love this game, but it is clearly apparent that it was a blatent farce designed to make a small games studio very rich on the backs of a lot of lies. Goodbye Hello Games, I will never purchase another title from your studio in 18 quintillion years (or like 255 years in actual people time)."

I think everyone knows that Hello Games and Sean Murray are liars. They blatantly lied about many of the games key gameplay features like huge ship battles, more fleshed AI, an actually interesting center of the universe, and so much more. Now let's get to Steam. Everyone should be able to refund the game no matter the play time or time purchased because Hello Games LIED about content that is NOT in the game that they said WOULD BE. That is unacceptable and steam is swallowing their pride. I'm very disappointed in Steam, Hello Games, and Sean Murray. I thought Steam would understand but no. Looks like they can't accept the fact that they sold a game with missing content that was indeed promised. Steam, I WANT MY MONEY BACK! Thumbs up if you are with me.2018 EDIT --- TRIED PLAYING THISâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥AGAIN, DIED, GRAVE WONT GIVE BACK ITEMS, 70 HOURS OF WORK GONE â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU HELLO GAMES"

Then slowly you will see the repeating themes and mechanics behind it and start to wonder if you have been fooled.So you leave the first start system after 8 hours of naming things and grinding rocks and realize the next one is the same. If you pre-ordered you already replaced your ship that was supposed to be somehow better with the next random find and realize it was worthless.You kill some spaceships and hope for something but nothing happens. You upgrade stuff and barely feel it. You have to endlessly grind the same materials over and over and manage your tiny inventory.THen it sets in, you paid $60 dollars for a tech demo that constantly RNGs its graphical objects with absolutely now evolution of gameplay, challenge, puzzles, secrets, NPCs, buildings, space stations or anything else you have ever seen.There is no reward loop, no progress, no meaningful anything except seeing which animal and plant parts the RNG stitched together this time around.I would get mad but its my fault. I bought the hype, I preordered, it sucks, im a sucker.This game is worth 14.99 in the summer sale and maybe 19.99 if you hate yourself and want to just waste enormous amounts of time on no tangible progress, story or fun."

It's a hot mess on the PC, and that's besides all of the broken promises that Sean Murray and Hello Games left us with. All of those broken promises will be rectified later down the line in paid DLC, I'm sure, based on Murray's quick turn around on the issue, so if you're a complete idiot, by all means, go ahead and pay $60 for a game that's worth maybe $15, then pay $45 for even more cut content that should've been in the original release."

With that admission, I complete my cycle of grief and I perma-delete this game from my library.With grief comes denial, anger, resentment, bargaining, and finally letting go.With almost 120 hours logged on No Man's Sky, I denied there was a problem. I flew around completing the monotonous tasks and idiotic conversations with 1-dimensional beings. I ignored the bad news that kept coming from the fans. And yet, I never made it to the center of the galaxy. I spent so much time exploring most planets. Even on the hottest of them, looking back, it was all cold and empty.Anger: When I finally admitted that I had been scammed and my sucker-for-shiny-spaceships inner child got stabbed in the face, I got angry. I uninstalled No Man's Sky and I wrote a searing castigation to Hello Games. In this letter that I never sent, I really let them have it. *nods in self-approval* (pathetic, no?)Resentment. This company made the biggest splash and had the most compelling E3(?) vid that a starving Sci-fi genre lapped up in hungry... uh... laps. When the veil parted and I saw the game as it truly stood, and after the burning sore on my soul spent its last embers fueling my hatred of Sean Murray, who wooed me and threw me away, I just sat there, with nothing but my resentment boxers on.Then I bargained. I shouldn't have pre-ordered. I would never pre-order again! I should have been wary of the amazing things in E3 vid! I would never be taken by a slick confidence display again! Of course, I'm probably going to get suckered again. That's why old people can be so bitter and skeptical: they get conned all their lives. And as I have these fizzling last thoughts, I come to acceptance and letting go.Like a really good date, that turned into a keyed car, feces left in the mailbox, hysterical, ranting voicemails, and sextings reposted to Facebook, the only thing left to do is cut and run; you have to change the number and move, delete everything, and hope he goes away. That's you, Sean Murray. You're that guy and I have to erase you from my life. Good-bye, Hello Games."

But then again, I've always achieved more joy/satisfaction from creating & discovering in video games than most of the populous. That still doesn't mean I'd recommend No Man's Sky.I would have refunded with the rest of humanity, if I hadnât completely forgotten that refunds existed while playing for the first time. I was so excited to finally be playing after hearing all of these amazing things I could do in this game, that I didn't even bother reading reviews. I didn't bother reading anything about the PS4 release all 3 days it was out before. I think it's because I was honestly the most excited I've ever been for a video game to release.I won't go into details about all the promises I was given & didn't receive (if you want more info on that, just Google  No Man's Sky , you'll find plenty of info, I'm sure)I don't support any purchase of this game nor do I support any developer associated with this game.Don't buy No Man's Sky. These guys don't deserve a single dime for what they've done, in my opinion."

After the game was pushed back I began to get more anxious. When I finally got my hands on the game, I was let down completely. I talked my friends into purchasing the game so we could explore this galaxy together, only to be let down by the lack of multiplayer even though Hello Game's director Sean Murray said you have the ability to run into other players. On top of that, my computer had huge framerate issues with the game and would even crash. I do not recommend this game at all."

It looks great, the planets have quite a bit of variety, and the progression and story are rewarding. Several additional updates and patches have come just in the short time I have owned it.The game is not still without faults though. On a high end PC I still have times of poor or inconsistient performance, and the occasional crash. Some elements can still get repetative, but within reason given it is procedurally generated. Certain mechanics are not well explained at the beginingOverall, for a sale price around $25, I would say this is a good buy if you enjoy this type of game."

And the first 12 hours were amazing...but after a while it started to be a bit repetitive. The  different  planets kinda looked the same...with the same kind of resources that needed mining. In the end it started to be like a minecraft with the only purpose of mining and selling what i mine for upgrades and a bigger,better looking chest. And all that is fine, but it's not sth for 60 euros...especially if monecraft,with all the building and redstonz possibilities, and the graphics of wolfenstein 3d is about 20â¬. So i feel that the dev's should look into sth like building and creating stuff or maybe a inter alien war or conflict in which we can choose sides and i don't know go through blocades to access a planet...i mean the trade ships are there with the autoturrets...sooo it could be possible to create that. Furthermore a small planetary attack on the HQ with some RL friends (to whom we can maybe set a waypoint to and travel there?). The possibilites and opportunities with this game are endless and it would be nice...and just for the dev's to at least try and implement these kind of changes for free for people who paid more that enough for this game."

Features that were shown in press videos are not in the game, more feature were cut from the game then were left in.   There is no point in naming or getting attached to planets since it is bordering on impossible to find your way back.   There are several mechanics like the upgrades chaining together if they are installed next to each other that are never covered in any tutorials.   On top of all of this the game is very shallow.   You can unlock all the upgrades, learn all the languages and max out your ship by visiting 3 systems.   3 different systems and around 30 hours will show you all this game has to offer.   Best review of this game I have read is that it is only a tech demo, someone will make a great game on top of this world generation tech but No Man's Sky is not that game and isn't worth the $60"

Unable to procure those extremely necessary recipes to be able to progress through the game as intended, I'm forced to make a choice.  I can wipe my save and start over, randomly search everything trying to find what the game was supposed to lead me to, or just stop playing.I chose to stop playing.  Unfortunately, I am not able to get a refund due to my played time, as this is the first game I've ever bought that I'd actually want a refund for.At some point, if they add more content and fix the numerous issues, I may give this game a shot.  Unfortunately I'm already out the $60 for what feels like an early access game."

Players who do not use mods can be at a serious disadvantage than players who do. That being said, I am not a fan of doing that when the company said they would already have those features in the game. Therefore, I will no longer be playing this game."

It is a fairly fun games for the first 2 hours as you learn the way the world works and find different planets. After about 5 hours of jumping around star systems looking for materials it gets very boring and repeatative.  The game has many bugs and glitches, almost as if it was a beta.  Hopefully patches will be added to make the game more exciting and enjoyable. Getting better in time."

There is little variation in the generated world geography(Where are my oceans?), no varied biomes on planets, little ship customization, only one class of usable ship, and no way to change it's external appearance. The list can go on forever.This game is super repetitive, with everything playing out around the 8 hour mark. Stations are essentially all the same, space combat is shallow, the crafting in this game is a joke. The Link below details some of the...features that were promised on the game, and never delievered. http://www.onemanslie.info/the-original-reddit-post/In summary, DO NOT GET THIS GAME.

This game was something special before and now we get a huge update. I had a few months when I didn't play NMS at all. After that period I feel that NMS is a one of a kind. Sure it has it's flaws but the feeling of exploring and space traveling, there's nothing quite like it. I really liked the game when it was released, even during the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥torm, but after these updates it's really getting better and better. So if you tried NMS before and felt that it lacked polish and content, but thought it was a cool concept, you should try it again."

Planets dont even have different biomes, just one biome per planet... most plants dont cast shadows... textures are low quality... spawns are unballanced and some rewards for some tasks are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T... You cant fly the ship close to the ground, you cant fly into a cave, you cant fly under a land bridge... and on some planets with floating islands or land bridges etc, your ship will actually FLING into space when trying to simply take off from landing. I dont know why you HAVE to get OUT of the ship when you land, and why you cant use your freaking TORCH during daytime.... EVEN IN CAVES??? There are SO MANY angry reviews and YouTube videos that SHOW you exactly whats wrong with this game and why it should NOT be considered finished, and should NOT COST $60!!! No personal waypoints, no brightness options (only gamma), no more than about 5 different on-planet missions and in reality, you can never actually see another player even if youre in the same place at the same time... and the game literally just repeats when you get to the center of the universe??? The amount of inventory management in this game is a game in and of itself... you can send stuff to your ship from any distance, but gotta be near the ship to get it back... what? AND THE SENTINALS.... ARE.... COPS....... SERIOUSLY, every time I see one of these â¥â¥â¥â¥ers, I feel uncomfortable, like Im being watched and judged, and if I even take a little Zinc for my suit so I dont DIE, they act like I smoked marijuana and start opening fire!!! I cant believe something with literally NO facial expressions can be SO EMOTIONAL.... when you see it fly up and scan the ground where the  crime  was committed, then rush over to scan your face like  WHAT DID YOU DO!?  ... it almost makes me laugh every time, but seriously, ALL SENTINALS ARE BASTARDS!!! Im done typing now, maybe I saved someone some trouble."

I wish I could still refund this game. I gave it a more than fair chance at 10 hours of gameplay but the reality is that the 10th hour was the same as the 1st. Hello Games' terrible business practices aside this product is awful in very many ways and asking $60 for it is downright asinine."

Buy it when it goes on sale for $4.99 or less.I remember thinking Hello Games got it right by offering a reason to pre-order the game:  a better ship to start out with!Five minutes into the game I realized that ship needed to be replaced, and this process would be continuous because ships increase in storage size as you progress through the game.Open world is a cool idea.  Open universe was even cooler.  However, the only good thing about this game is it will spawn better games of a similar experience.  In other words, I paid $60 to fly around to near-infinitely generated worlds that have almost exact resources and creatures, but with different colors and radiation or temperature levels.  Also, there are only three sentient alien races and one race of robots/sentinels.  The objectives of each so-called mission are always the same, they're too easy, surviving is too easy, resources are too abundant to be fun, and you can't even choose to be a bad guy.  I got so sick of playing after a few hours that I started shooting down every ship I could find and it didn't even matter.  All three races treated me the same as they always had.  This game was a great idea until it actually happened.  It's even more disappointing that there won't be any DLC.For the love of all that is fun, please, someone make DLC for this game.  It would be amazing if I could use metal to build a home, or start a government, or fight a tyrannical government in one solar system while collecting vital resources for people in another solar system.  I wanted fun.  Instead I got mindless exploration.  I'm about 50 hours in and I stopped caring a long time ago.  I figured I need to feel better about myself and get at least an hour of entertainment for every dollar I paid for this game.  I'm really not that entertained, though."

But when you really boil the game down, it's just a survival game. Yes, it may be a survival game with space travel, but it's just a survival game. Also, the game is incredibly overpriced. I feel like Hello Games tried to market this game as a polished AAA title. But it's not. Hello Games is just another indie group that's made a few games no one's heard of before. They created way too much hype, set everyone's expectations to high, and all in all, disappointed us."

(Elite: Dangerous comes to mind.)If you want planet exploration and development, there's Starbound. I could justify buying this at $30, but it's too overpriced for what it is at $60. As of this review I am refunding, and will take another look at it after the game has had time to mature.It's basically an Early Access game without the label.This is my opinion, and your mileage may vary."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 30, 2018              I waited to buy this game until after the NEXT update, on a Steam sale for about half price from release. Short Version: For a certain kind of player, this game is gold. For others, this game will disappoint. I've heard it described as  Minecraft in Space  and after 100 hours in I think that's fairly accurate. For self-starter, self-directed players who set their own game goals, this game is gold. But if you're the kind of player who expects the story to be compelling and pull you along, or if you're expecting a good mutliplayer experience, give it a pass (until a future update, I imagine). This is a good single-player space exploration and building game. It's not a good multiplayer experience and it's not a good story-driven experience. It's thin in a few areas that I expect may be enhanced over time given what the team accomplished with the NEXT update. Long Version: I've been looking for a good  open universe  space game since Origin's  Privateer  was released in 1993. That game let you do whatever you wanted (in space only) within the confines of the game engine: trade, mercenary, pirate, hunt main quest enemies, etc. But it was a thin game limited by the technology of the time. There was no planetary exploration, for instance. Still, it was a solid formula that was copied when Digital Anvil released  Freelancer  in 2003. The closest thing I've come to enjoying since that time was  X2: The Threat , and while it had a deep trading/commercial-empire aspect to it, the combat mechanics in that game were terrible and you couldn't explore worlds or build structures. A few other games have come along since, but they all have huge flaws, like  no cockpit/1st-person view , or no base building, or no planetary exploration. Nothing has scratched that  Privateer  itch for me or really moved the space genre forward at all. Until now. No Man's Sky definitely pushed the genre forward, but it also took a couple steps backward at the same time. It is absolutely wonderful to be able to warp to a new system in No Man's Sky, fly toward a planet, drop into atmosphere, fly over the planet surface and explore the various points of interest, then jet back out into space again, all without a loading screen. What Hello Games has accomplished with their procedurally generated code is nothing short of amazing. They've pushed the genre forward; there's no going back after this. The game does a lot of stuff really well. The crafting aspects of the game is well organized, easy to understand and works. Resource harvesting, blueprint acquisition, base building - it's all very well done. The game dangles a lot of  carrots  in front of you. A huge part of this game is spending time trying to find the next   better  Multi-tool or space ship and then upgrading the gear in your Exosuit, ship and multi-tool. Finding a new ship, a better ship, is like Christmas morning. The game offers a fun trading economy (I enjoy finding lucrative trade routes) and base building is well done.  There are a host of  missions  that one can take give you access to an array of rewards and often have you exploring planets you might never otherwise have stepped foot on. But the game is not without fault. Where the game falls short a bit is in a few areas: 1) The combat is simplistic and underwhelming. It feels very much like Freelancer combat on PC with a mouse (the worst way to play a flight-sim style game). The ships are setup so they all have the same speed, turn radius, weapons and AI. They spin everytime they fly at you and get hit, they turn around and fly straight into you again. You can put several different weapons on your ship, but each of them, fully upgraded, doesn't seem to have any advantage over the others. You're just as well off to use one weapon and never worry about switching between them. It's just an underwhelming expeirence. It's pretty to look at, but it doesn't have 1/10th the strategic or tactical depth of the classic LucasArts X-Wing or Tie-Fighter games. This is the one aspect of the game I hope sees several fixes in future updates. 2) Bounty Hunting is too simple. Once you get a bounty mission, you fly right out of the Space Station and your enemy is waiting. No need to hunt from system to system looking for them; they are always right there in front of you. Fairly lame. 3) Freighters don't seem to serve much purpose. They're neat to look at, but 100+ hours into the game I haven't seen a single mission where I can take my Freighter and fleet and make them a part of some epic space battle.  4) There is no way to sell off extra ships, which puts a ceiling on ship acquisition. You'll find ships you can salvage, but there seems to be a hard-cap of 6 ships. Once you hit that limit, you have to trade some in. The game really needs a way to sell unwanted ships outright even if it is for pennies on the dollar. 5) There are some bugs, but Hello Games releases patches frequently. I've only ran into one serious bug and a save/reload fixed it. 6) The story, and writing, are a bit underwhelming and somewhat difficult to get into. I find myself fast-clicking through most of the dialog just to get to the  reward  or advance the quest to the next step. 7) There's not much of a multi-player aspect to the game and people who have tried to work together have run into far more bugs than single-players encounter. Some of these flaws I fully expect to see improved over time, especially given what they've already accomplished with the NEXT update; they've improved the game a lot according to the people I have talked to who have played since release. So I fully expect further updates to address some of these issues. Bottom Line:  I think it's a great game for what it is right now, and I think it could be an all-time great game with further updates. It is enjoyable for me to play right now and totally worth the sale price. Whether the game continues to evolve and grow will determine its value in the future."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 31, 2016              Well I actually find the game quite relaxing to play but as time draws on more and more things just start to grind on me. Straight up I'd recommend it if you like this kind of game and it was priced around a quarter of it's current price.But there in lies the rub. How do you know what kind of game it is when the first video trailer of clearly ingame footage as part of the store page contains lots of elements that do not actually feature in the game or are different enough in negative ways.Take, for example, the discoveries: in the video it looks very seemless and slick but instead you now have to focus on the object with your visor until it's completed it's discovery. Repeat over and over and it all feels a bit clunky.The ship flight is nothing like as per the video, you know the one on the store page trying to convince you to buy. The animal behaviours are not as per the video either, in fact, it appears the larger animals haven't even been seen.It's a shame because some of these things should be relatively easy to add and I hope they do. I never really expected the worlds to have biomes as such but I would have thought the algorithms would consider things like distance to sun to determine basics such as temperature. It's also confusing to have large populations of fauna on desolate rocks but nothing on lush green planets teeming with flora.There is disappointment in the lack of basic world simulation such as rotation of planets but I do understand why such things can get chalked up as bug during playtesting, i.e. one minute something was there, the next it's not because it's on the other side of the planet. I'd have hoped the devs would point out this is a feature of the game and try to find ways to assist those struggling to cope with these things, instead a shortcut was seemingly found.This list could go on but fundamentally the store page video is the largest disappointment as it reminds you of what you remembered the game to be before release. I'm actually shocked they haven't pulled it and replaced it with actual gameplay. This all feels like publisher pressure to get the game shipped before some of these things could be properly realised.Finally, if you can look beyond some of the poorly implemented menus, ui and game mechanisms it can be quite a chillout game, even the alien interaction should be seen more like Interactive Fiction than an RPG style game and it becomes a different thing altogether and a more enjoyable experience."

Interesting ideas, but way too many problems and not enough content to justify $60. This is a $20 - $30 dollar game, tops. I paid much less than $30, and even I can still see a lot of flaws.Cons: JOURNEY MILESTONE  events interrupt gameplay frequently. How did this make it in the final game?Ship control planetside is lackluster; landing precisely is impossible.Ship combat in space is just... terrible. Slow and hardly precise.Inventory juggling as a way to limit progression.Flora is very samey on most planets.It's not well explained why some waypoints don't clear after you go to them.Upgrades are kind of random, so within 2-3 hours you are already getting  You already know this  messages.Optimization woes.Too many vocal prompts from suit. 75% is not  low  for life support.Game boils down to looting everything, flying, looting everything, flying, with not enough to break it up.Lots of dumb planet names already.  CHILL GREEN STUFF AND WATER  a lot, at least for me.Black holes either give terrible feedback on distance, shoot you randomly in a direction, or are bugged.Atlas path bugged out and didn't send me to a new galaxy.All ships handle exactly the same, regardless of size.Pros:Travel in space can be fun.The language system is interesting.Some interesting sights, when they do occur.Not completely devoid of combat, even if it's mediocre.Pass on this until they add some worthwhile content. I don't think multiplayer will fix this as there's nothing to do with other players. I was hoping this would scratch my Star Citizen itch while they chug along, but this doesn't really do a whole lot for me."

Now, with the relase of 1.3, I decided to try it out again, and oh my has it improved. It actually feels like a game now, instead of a bad tech demo. The story is interesting to follow, the mission system makes it so you can explore and stay in the same system without being bored. Planets are much more interesting, and the flight system has improved hugely. Enabling low flight mode would have been a winner in itself, but it came with so much more.If you have tried and been disappointed before, never heard of it before or have heard negative reviews about the old NMS... give it another go. I'm going to have a lot of fun with this."

I really hope that the dev team can get stuff sorted out and can eventually create more dynamics for the game. I also hope that they were just having issues on their servers and that's why players can't see each other, but with the devs remaining silent and previously promising a multiplayer game and then delivering a single player experience I feel that my money is better used else ware. If the game eventually comes around and they fix it I may be inclined to repurchase their game but not without some serious investigating into the game."

I tried really hard but even after getting through all the technical issues, the game just hard freezes and crashes before I can do anything meaningful. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It's in line with some of the worst ports ever, worse than Batman Arkham Knight. Why? Well because I am getting about the same frame rate as that game at launch, except this game doesn't have nearly as detailed graphics. How's that for a starter? lazy poor optimization is always a good start.Now let's talk about the menus, being a bad port it obviously has to be frustrating to use with mouse because nobody gave any thought to it, they just feed the mouse movements directly to their controler input codes as quickly as possible. The result is the following:-You have to long-press to activate anything, not just in-game stuff, if you want to change your resolution you have to long-press the arrow to switch it over one notch. Yep....-Sensitivity doesn't doâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ That's right you can't change look sensitivity if you play with mouse.-Mouse acceleration is always on and totally horrible. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT A CONTROLLER because it will destroy all your FPS aiming reflexes. In fact do not play this game at all, because it'sâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥"

When I first started, I didn't care much about the low-res textures and 20-40 FPS I was getting, I was just excited to get off the planet and start exploring. Alas, the more I explored, the more I saw the similarities between each planet. Each planet has the exact same textures, just recolored. The flora is of a limited variety, and you'll find a lot of planets with the same exact mushroom sprite, just recolored to seem different. There may be 18 quintillion planets, but they all pretty much share the same basic resources and population. I got bored after about my 10th system. I tried using mods to spice things up (BigThings, LowFlight), but I got bored of those even quicker.In short, this game is just an overhyped broken promise from Hello Games. If they ever improve the game to be more of what it was shown as, then I may repurchase it, but for now I'll go take my money and spend it on a game I'll actually enjoy.P.S.If you want to play a game with much better orbital mechanics and exploration, Kerbal Space Program is 50% off this weekend."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 28, 2016              As someone who did not follow the hype for the game, I can honestly say I am disappointed.Looking at videos of people actually enjoing they game, I thought this could be something for me. They had a nice ship and flew to nice planets and mined some here and there. They said the game wasn't for everyone, and you had to like the gameplay. It looked likable to me. It looked like I would be able to sit back and relax while listening to some relaxing procedurally generated music or something along the lines of that. Well it wasn't like that for me. Not at all really. Moving around on itself takes ages unless you hold down the sprint button constantly, before then having to use your jetpack and when you are depleted, the game almost stops. You will randomly be attacked by predators, and on planets without animals, with many resources, you will most likely be attacked by the sentinels instead. There is no relaxing element here, other than helping you get tired before going to bed, which for there are other more enjoyable actvities.Despite all of the negative stuff I wrote in the paragraph above, I would continue to play it just for completing it and some small dopamin releases every other hour or so. But no, I couldn't do that either. If you think you have the computer to run this, you are wrong, unless you are an elite master race player. In the current state of the game, the minimum requirements are WRONG. I have a PC with more than enough capacity to run it according to the minimum requirements. But according to me playing it, that's not the case. Frequent FPS drops and a maximum fps of 45 on low settings made it hard for me to enjoy this already rather boring experience. On planets that were actually a bit cool and had some foliage, the FPS could drop down to around 25-20 or even lower, even when I was just walking. Would I have kept playing with all of this negativity? Yes. But that wasn't everything.After grinding and mining for thirty minutes, soon being ready to buy a new and better ship for the first time in 13 hours, the game crashed. No save points in thirty minutes. That was it for me. The game had crashed before of course, and even did it once during the launch screen. And if the game actually ran smooth, the game is still not worth sixty god damn dollars. When something is priced that high you expect it to at least have the optimization and polish level of games usually at that price level. I have no trust in Hello Games right now. If they do not clear up this mess and make the game at least somewhat like they promised, I will not touch this game with a ten foot pole again. If you're gonna boy this, at least make sure to wait for a sale of at least 50% and make sure you have a top tier computer with 16GB of RAM, an octacore proccessor and the latest of the latest within graphics, e.g. the GTX1080. In which case, you can play much better games at graphical levels ten times more advanced and with better optimization. Please don't waste your money on this"

It has Minecraft elements such as resource gathering, but doesn't contain anyway of imparting your own personality onto the universe. Sure, you can name trees, plants, planets and systems, but given that the likelihood of someone coming to those systems is very low, then what's the point?

        "Comments": "Posted: August 12, 2016              I can't even comment on the gameplay because it can't be played. I tried really hard but even after getting through all the technical issues, the game just hard freezes and crashes before I can do anything meaningful. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It's in line with some of the worst ports ever, worse than Batman Arkham Knight. Why? Well because I am getting about the same frame rate as that game at launch, except this game doesn't have nearly as detailed graphics. How's that for a starter? lazy poor optimization is always a good start.Now let's talk about the menus, being a bad port it obviously has to be frustrating to use with mouse because nobody gave any thought to it, they just feed the mouse movements directly to their controler input codes as quickly as possible. The result is the following:-You have to long-press to activate anything, not just in-game stuff, if you want to change your resolution you have to long-press the arrow to switch it over one notch. Yep....-Sensitivity doesn't doâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ That's right you can't change look sensitivity if you play with mouse.-Mouse acceleration is always on and totally horrible. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT A CONTROLLER because it will destroy all your FPS aiming reflexes. In fact do not play this game at all, because it'sâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥"

The awe of discovery and naming planets and creatures is short lived because there is literally nothing else to do in the game. All you do is fly from planet to planet, gathering reasources so that you can continue to fly from planet to planet. Sure,  you can invest in a ship with a bigger inventory and a larger back pack, but those slots will just hold more resources to help you do....you guessed it: fly from plant to planet. (Slight spoler): Somehow, the ending is even worse than the rote and repetitive gameplay. Please, do not buy this game."

Hollow gameplay - barely any content (somehow). every planet has the same objectives; Mine, find POI's, upgrade some stuff, look at things, then fly away.2. Procedurally generated repitition! - Each system has a different number of planets. They are just different freakin colors with life that consists of 'shuffled' pre-designed body parts. Some are hot, and some are cold.....OMG some are poison too... whoa, that's it. Every planet has the same 4 or 5 types of buildings as well.3. Flying is almost completely done for you. Push button to lift off, push button to land (doesnt really matter where). Your star ship is basically on a rail system. You cant crash, period. you cant even swoop down and skim the planets surface. The only thing you can hit, are the astroids AROUND EVERY PLANET??!?!??! Oh yeah, dont worry about dying. there isnt any penalty. if a space pirate kills you, just fly back and grab ALL OF YOUR STUFF from the waypoint they leave you.4. No depth to the solar systems at all. every system looks like a  jumble  of planets grouped together in a different color haze. You cant actually fly above everything and witness the distance from the star. I have yet to see gas giants or moons either. Just life on every planet...with buildings...I put about 14 hours into this game and I can confidently say that ive done pretty much everything you can do, in there GIANT PROCEDURAL UNIVERSE.Absolute non-sense. do not buy this game right now. They need to regroup, reevaluate and deliver the  revolutionary  game that they spoke about. THIS IS NOT IT.Edit: 8/23/16--------------------***I'm not trying to come off too salty here. It's just the price we paid for this, does not justify the current content provided. It is safe to say that this game has Massive potential. I hope hello games delivers..."

The game I bought does not match the game advertised.Many of the committed/demonstrated features do not appear to exist in the game, including air combat that originates in-atmosphere, wingmen and flight formations, dynamic atmospheric maneuvers (aka, flying low/under/around objects), pack-behavior in fauna, and so on. I played about 15 hours, in hopes those features would be unlocked; I've unlocked about 50% of achievements, but so far these features have not yet materialized.Game performance is sluggish, buggy, and prone to crashing, even on a higher-end PC (4690k/GTX 980). Pop-in and this ugly  materializing  effect are rampant. Textures are muddy, and even running at 1440p the game has pronounced sharpness issues.The game performs like and is featured like an early access game with 2-3 years left to develop. I do not purchase early access games for exactly the reasons I described above.I requested a refund, as the game I purchased does not match what is described, demonstrated, or marketed. Steam has denied my refund request (I am definitely over the time limit)."

To travel to another solar system you just select one then wait out a loading screen. No variety of ships (purely cosmetic differences). Only TWO weapons and ONE Shield. No interesting NPC interactions. Pros: Visually beautiful, albeit highly repetitive. True sense of vastness of the universe. Very, very easy difficulty if you enjoy casual games.Conclusion: 6/10 all things considered. It's a 'buy in a sale' title."

When I first started, I didn't care much about the low-res textures and 20-40 FPS I was getting, I was just excited to get off the planet and start exploring. Alas, the more I explored, the more I saw the similarities between each planet. Each planet has the exact same textures, just recolored. The flora is of a limited variety, and you'll find a lot of planets with the same exact mushroom sprite, just recolored to seem different. There may be 18 quintillion planets, but they all pretty much share the same basic resources and population. I got bored after about my 10th system. I tried using mods to spice things up (BigThings, LowFlight), but I got bored of those even quicker.In short, this game is just an overhyped broken promise from Hello Games. If they ever improve the game to be more of what it was shown as, then I may repurchase it, but for now I'll go take my money and spend it on a game I'll actually enjoy.P.S.If you want to play a game with much better orbital mechanics and exploration, Kerbal Space Program is 50% off this weekend."

They had a nice ship and flew to nice planets and mined some here and there. They said the game wasn't for everyone, and you had to like the gameplay. It looked likable to me. It looked like I would be able to sit back and relax while listening to some relaxing procedurally generated music or something along the lines of that. Well it wasn't like that for me. Not at all really. Moving around on itself takes ages unless you hold down the sprint button constantly, before then having to use your jetpack and when you are depleted, the game almost stops. You will randomly be attacked by predators, and on planets without animals, with many resources, you will most likely be attacked by the sentinels instead. There is no relaxing element here, other than helping you get tired before going to bed, which for there are other more enjoyable actvities.Despite all of the negative stuff I wrote in the paragraph above, I would continue to play it just for completing it and some small dopamin releases every other hour or so. But no, I couldn't do that either. If you think you have the computer to run this, you are wrong, unless you are an elite master race player. In the current state of the game, the minimum requirements are WRONG. I have a PC with more than enough capacity to run it according to the minimum requirements. But according to me playing it, that's not the case. Frequent FPS drops and a maximum fps of 45 on low settings made it hard for me to enjoy this already rather boring experience. On planets that were actually a bit cool and had some foliage, the FPS could drop down to around 25-20 or even lower, even when I was just walking. Would I have kept playing with all of this negativity? Yes. But that wasn't everything.After grinding and mining for thirty minutes, soon being ready to buy a new and better ship for the first time in 13 hours, the game crashed. No save points in thirty minutes. That was it for me. The game had crashed before of course, and even did it once during the launch screen. And if the game actually ran smooth, the game is still not worth sixty god damn dollars. When something is priced that high you expect it to at least have the optimization and polish level of games usually at that price level. I have no trust in Hello Games right now. If they do not clear up this mess and make the game at least somewhat like they promised, I will not touch this game with a ten foot pole again. If you're gonna boy this, at least make sure to wait for a sale of at least 50% and make sure you have a top tier computer with 16GB of RAM, an octacore proccessor and the latest of the latest within graphics, e.g. the GTX1080. In which case, you can play much better games at graphical levels ten times more advanced and with better optimization. Please don't waste your money on this"

The premise of the game has been discussed to death, however, it's how limited and restricted that game is when it comes to delivering the game play is it's main downfall.Ultimately, the game is lacking in any depth whatsoever. It has Minecraft elements such as resource gathering, but doesn't contain anyway of imparting your own personality onto the universe. Sure, you can name trees, plants, planets and systems, but given that the likelihood of someone coming to those systems is very low, then what's the point? If a T-Rex/Lizard Bear called Barry69 â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the woods on planet HarambeLivesHere, then if no one else ever sees it, why should it exist?"

I in good conscience cannot give this game a positive rating.The music is good, the visuals are fantastic.That aside, let's get into it:1) Crafting. Typical method of use to impede advancement in a game. There's a lot of stuff here, for weapons, mods, mining, etc. Resources as well that can be bought or traded on the galactic market. Overall, it's a time sink. Not necessarily a bad one. It forces you to explore learn an expand what you know.2) The flying and walking controls seem... limited. Definitely as if it was designed with consoles in mind. Your ship cannot fly below a certain altitude whilst planet side, and even when walking, I've had the camera shoot in a random direction. Which has led to a few issues with the drones.3) After getting up to the point where I was freely jumping between stars, I came to realize that this was suddenly all too very familiar: The Space Leg of SPORE. The one part of the game that always made me start over, because it was so absolutely monotonus and dull. A consistent grind for resources, and with any lack of apparent story or driving force other than 'get to the galactic center', my interest immediately doured.All in all... The game looks SPECTACULAR. It really does. But it plays like a console title, and it feels like something from the Atari 2600 era. There are enough games out there with mindless grind, that one more simply will not fit into my library, and they are far more engaging directly to someone with as severe a case of ADHD as myself.I wanted to like this game. I really did. I'm sorry, Hello Games. But bless your sweet heart and your passion, it just wasn't good enough."

It just gets extremely old extremely fast. For $60, this is a robbery. It should be $15, then it might be worth the price. Might. I regret making the purchase, if I am being honest. Look at my play time, I've logged hours into this thing. Haven't accomplished anything though. It's fun if you just want to waste time. There's no story to speak of, no goals, no end-game. No multiplayer. Even if you encounter a place someone else has been you can't do anything there.Don't be the guy like me who didn't follow the game but got excited right before release and watched videos hyping it. The guy who made this, Sean something...unfortunately he is writing checks with his mouth that he just can't cash. Because he said a LOT of stuff about what this game would be and he's been backtreading ever since.Def don't watch the E3 footage from a couple years ago and get excited either. Nothing like that is in this game."

There are those out there who will say that  the game was overhyped  or  the players got too excited over an indie game and reality wasn't as kind.  No. No, no, no, no, no. What developer Sean Murray told us and showed us and promised us in no uncertain terms was a huge pile of steaming lies. They showedcased space battles,  rogue  Sentinels, freighters flying under the atmosphere and crashed, he told us about multiplayer and planets hundreds of times hotter or colder than Earth has ever seen, and NONE of it was true. If you want a list, they're plentiful on Google. But this game was the straw that broke the camel's back for me, and I can honestly say that after this, I will most likely never pre-order a game again. This was the game that brought the dreams of hundreds of thousands of people to life, and blatantly spit in our faces, all the while laughing that they managed to pull off a global misdirection and sell this game for the price of a AAA title from an established company."

I travelled millions of kilometers, refilling my thrusters so often that I burned through all my resources and had to stop to mine some conveniently placed asteroids. Eventually I just gave up, realizing that I'd been played for a fool. It's not a sun. It's just a light on my screen, infinitely distant. As far as I know you can never reach it. And that's this game in a nutshell: it seems gargantuan, but dig just a little bit and you're going to strike bottom very, very quickly. I wanted to love this game, but it's just so...bare. You'll discover things, and it's cool at first, yeah. Sooner or later though, you find that the  many different planets  really just boil down to a small handful of biomes with a unifying artistic style for everything from foliage and rocks to creatures and aliens. You'll be absolutely wowed for the first hour or two, but it just starts to become a drag as you realize that your discoveries aren't entirely unique OR meaningful.As you wander around and discover these things that aren't entirely unique or meaningful, you'll have to survive your environments. Space is unforgiving, and so on these strange new planets you need to maintain your life support gear, weapons, ship thrusters, hyperdrive capability...the list may not go on much farther, but frankly the system is too high-maintenance for my taste because the inventory slots that you possess are disgustingly few in number. Getting a ship with more slots helps, but the irritating prospect remains: a single alien trinket, which could be sold for a good deal of currency that might be used to buy crafting supplies or even a new weapon or ship, takes up the same amount of inventory space as a ton or so of yellow cake uranium or whatever you're using to power your thrusters these days. Find another valuable trinket? Yeah, it doesn't stack with the first one. Imagine buying two warehouses and filling one with solid gold and another with a single medallion. That is the concept we're getting at here.Gathering minerals itself is a horrid task. Slow, annoying, unengaging...until a stupid robot flies in front of your mining laser. Then you're in a firefight with multiple sentries that just happen to exist on this barren planet. The shooting mechanics are not great. It's just not a fun experience.Same goes for space combat: I cannot ever recommend getting into a fight in your ship if you can avoid it. Either I'm just really bad at it, or I can say with some confidence that you will probably just die.Every feature just feels like it's missing something (and if you have been following the internet hellstorm, it's because the devs lied), which brings me back to my original point: this game feels barren. There is a lack of depth that is glaringly obvious in so many ways, from the combat to AI to the variety of life forms. It just gets boring so very quickly, and I simply cannot recommend it at $60. If you want to see what all the fuss is about, wait for it to reach less than 10 USD. I'm no economics major, but if I had to guess, that shouldn't be too much longer."

Hopefully there is a patch soon to fix the fps.after 20ish+ hours now I feel like i have wasted my money on a unfinished game that was sold as a finished game. It should of been a $30 greenlight game. This game only has weak fighting that is meaningless (on the ground and in flight). Mining is a joke. Once you see 4 or 5 worlds you have seen them all just change the screen color. The survival part is there but it is laughable. A large amount of the things that have been shown or stated will be in the game at launch are missing (there is great reddit post on this). If you are going to spend $60 on a unfinished game then just buy elite dangerous at least in the game you get what you are told you are getting.... Well now I am going to force my self to grind out at least 40 more hours so I can feel a little better about my waste of money..."

Oh well I bet if you could understand the language, you would encounter different scripts and stories . Nope. I have completely translated Korvax and about 200 words in Gek ignorantly hoping I'D find some something unique(frankly I love grinding in games). Absolutely nothing unique between worlds, buildings, creatures, OR CONVERSATIONS. The only thing that changes IS THE GOD DAMN WEATHER (warning, radiation levels rising. Warning extreme cold eminent.

The game is you mindlessly traveling the same 5 planets just a different retexture, collecting the same elements just so you can travel more. There is no civilization to find just little trading huts, the story is a complete piece of crap. You can't create building or stuctures all you do is collect sell, fly around and travel to another planet <-- which is the same planet just a diferent color."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 25, 2016              I've held off writing a review for this game because I want to give it a thumbs up, but currently can't because I think the price point is too high.  If the price drops significantly I'll change my recommendation.No Man's Sky is a game (and I say game roughly) that probably would only appeal to enthusiasts of procedural generation.  If you spent any amount of time in SpaceEngine, then I would say you would likely enjoy putting some hours into this game as some point.  Technically speaking what it does it does well; I am not currently aware of any other piece of software that is this robust in world generation, especially in regards to flora and fauna.  That being said you will still see a fair amount of repetition, uninteresting worlds and outright bizarrely constructed objects. Gameplay elements are very minimalistic; there is some progression but most of this can be burned through rather quickly and isnât terribly interesting.  Crafting is simplistic and most resource nodes are overly abundant.  Combat is bland and uninteresting; generally, youâll only be fighting one type of enemy for the majority of the game which can quickly be dispatched.  Galactic economics is virtually non-existent; there is no really no reason to participate in trading especially with the limiting inventory system.  Space combat is simplistic and the controls are incredibly imprecise considering the amount of drift / sliding taking place (only the mouse is supported).There is a little bit of scripted content but not much, which provides some minimal direction for the gameâs ultimate goal which is to get to the center of the galaxy.  Snippets of lore are scattered around but there isnât a lot of depth to them.  The game isnât scientifically accurate, but rather it's more of an artistic experience that makes heavy use of colors and filters.Iâd say overall if the price of the game drops significantly and you want something you could feasibly get 5 â 20 hours of entertainment. Or if youâre like me and this game scratches an itch that not many other games can then perhaps many more hours."

Infact- the only real thing to do in this game is make money so you can get more inventory slots to hold more things to sell and thus make more money. Every planet begins to look like the last one, and even those that dont, once you spend about 5 minutes on them you've seen all there is to see as any wildlife you may fight will either do nothing, or attack you. In short, No Man's Sky is a game that leaves you wishing there was more to do than an endless loop of 'make money to make more money'. Save your cash, no amount of DLC can save a game this hollow and empty."

I get that people that reordered got essentially duped. That's the past, what is important is what is now.I heard about this game before I ever had a system good enough for modern gaming. I really liked the idea, and when I finally got a new system together running with the best hardware, this was one of the games that I picked up early in to my collection.I was fortunate, I bought it while it was on sale, paid perhaps $30 or so, and I think that was a perfect price point. I began playing without reading anything about the how to play, just dove in and wanted an experience that would progress naturally.Well, I'm glad I did. I didn't have any expectations, and I enjoyed dozens of hours just flying around from planet to planet, exploring and seeking out new things. After a while, though, I did realize that there were a limited number of biomes, so planets start to look the same with some random variations. I also noticed that the creatures and plants all had common bases, so the variety became less noticeable too.So, I began then to explore the missions that the game offered via the Atlas Path. I was already about 110 hours in, and I realized there was a whole lot of gameplay that was just waiting for me. Yeah, for the most part, the storyline is just some text on the screen, but it definitely added a layer to the game. It also explosed the player to important features and abilities, so I suggest getting the central story going sooner than later.Anyway, I've clocked over 300+ hours in the game, I'm not sure how much of the  394 hours played  was active gameplay, but I'd assume the majority has been actual gameplay. I spent considerable time mapping out waypoints on my home planet, using two points of reference and triangulation. I spend countless hours keeping a log on planet attributes in a spreadsheet and noting interesting finds.I found ways to play this game that fit my interests. Yet, there are many different ways to play this game, and that is something that is great about it. I wasn't too interested in space battles and ran from most until recently. I never bought a freighter, but after farming and crafting some valueable items, I now have my own collection of ships.In a few days, the much awaited multiplayer updates will be live, and this will add yet another way to enjoy this game. Building will be limitless, and owning multiple bases is really going to make things exciting.I've been trying to get something fun like this out of Star Citizen, but it's a train wreck that sometimes works and looks pretty. But now, No Man's Sky will be everything I could want out of Star Citizen without waiting years for a possible functioning game.Very happy with the upcoming update of No Man's Sky and happy to have enjoyed the 300+ hours already. Here's to 300 more."

When it comes down to it that is what this game is about.I wouldn't be intimidated by the negative reviews anymore. They are a result of a new company without experience who made promises they couldn't keep on release of the game.This game is vastly different from its initial release, and even 70 hours into the game I am still discovering new types of planets, and familiarizing myself with new objectives in the game.In simplest terms, this game is essentially space minecraft. It is a charming game that sucks you into a world of creation and discovery. That being said, of course the game has its flaws. For example, glitches that fling you across the map and get you killed or getting forced into space battles when you are just on your way to sell some minerals.This is a game that deserves a chance. The developers clearly care about it and it's player base. If you think it is a game up your alley, I would be surprised if you bought it and didn't think it was worth the investment."

Gameplay is not on steam but on GOG Version. Total gametime is 40 hours.Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGgM-ybOLw0 Text:Lets start with the issues... because oh boy - are there issues. Most of those stem from two primary problems. First is the technical implementation and the second one is a design choice of  console first .From a PC Perspective the game has a multitude of crashes and FPS issues. With options breaking the game and even an GTX 1080 not able to pull a stable 60FPS. Many players couldn't even get it to run due to missing libraries and driver issues.The design problem stems from a PS4 choice in relation to the UI interaction. With little to no effort put into the PC. Scrolling in a menu seems to have been forgotten from the magical land of no mans sky and forbid the heavens if you tried to drag and drop in your inventory.Especially the inventory provided a TON of issues with both it's annoying use and limited size mostly hindered gameplay instead of enriching it.Speaking about inventory size, you'll be doing a lot of jumping back and forth and gathering materials time and again over and over because you cant carry enough with you. Out of fuel? Heh, go gather because no way in hell you could stock up on it. Need upgrades for your character ? Time to relinquish that inventory space you desperately need.Coupled with the massive number of items you 'll gather and no map to find trading posts, you'll be frustrated endlessly.While initially the space exploration sounds like great fun, by the 5th star system and 20th planet it all blends together an you mostly just stop caring and start following the blinking light to the next stop, only getting the bare minimum you need. Exploring is time consuming and bland, and the number of tech you find is often duplicate and thus a waste of time.All of this gets better the longer you play and the closer to the galactic core you get, but honestly, after 20 hours  getting to the good part  isn't solving the rest of the mundane survival experience that other games do better.The best part of the game in my eyes is the language system with words being learned one at a time and literally needing to figure out what aliens are saying.Overall, no mans sky isn't a terrible game, but it is flawed and in serious need of patching. So while I would recommend the experience for those who love survival / exploration games, i would only do so after they resolve the many many PC issues and only if they discount the title.Right now, this is one you might to hold of on."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 16, 2016              Portable DescriptionNo Manâs Sky is best described as an indie space exploration simulator. Outfitted with an Exosuit, a harvesting Multi-tool, and a Starship, your task is to traverse the unknown and survive. Whether you choose to travel towards the center of the galaxy, along the Atlas path, or with your own free will, prepare to spend many hours trekking through this âepicâ adventure.GameplayThe GalaxyThe galaxy is comprised of multitudes of star systems. Within each star system are: multiple planets, a single space station, and multiple freighters â guaranteed. Utilizing astronomical taxonomy, there are four types of star systems that players can explore, with subsequent systems containing âbetterâ planets (not that much better in my opinion). These are:Yellow stars: Class G or F â default system, what you will see until mid-game.Red Stars: Class K or M â requires Sigma warp drive upgrade.Green Stars: Class E â requires Tau warp drive upgrade.Blue Stars: Class B or O â requires Theta warp drive upgrade.ExplorationThe bulk of the gameplay is obviously exploration. The main types of encounters and their purposes/rewards can be categorized below (on-planet):Monoliths/Ruins: alien vocabulary - aids in diplomacy and dialogue options.Outposts/Shelters/Drop Pods: technology & formula blueprints.Transmissions & Distress Beacons: technology/starship blueprints & crashed starships.Offworld Events: space anomalies, distress signals, Atlas Interfaces, black holes, space pirates, etc.SurvivalA very weak, yet mildly successful survival aspect, is incorporated to help improve immersion and add further gameplay (arguably padding). Everything in NMS needs fuel or maintenance, in one form or another. Everything. There are various elements (Carbon, Iron, Iridium, Plutonium, etc.) that must be mined using your upgradable Multi-tool (gun) which satisfy these requirements, mostly exosuit (survival)/starship operations. These elements have a rarity index, and are also used to craft technology from discovered blueprints. Although survival, crafting, and maintenance isnât very difficult or worrisome later on, many people will find this aspect a major drag, especially in the early stages of exploration when inventory management is really tedious. I personally enjoy this game mechanic and believe it is necessary to facilitate space exploration simulation though, so take that how you will.What a large population of players hate regarding the survival aspect, has to deal with fueling the hyper drive, which is completely understandable. Every time you want to warp to the next star system, you need to fuel your hyper drive with a warp cell. This warp cell requires antimatter, electron vapor, and suspension fluid recipes, along with all intermediary and base elements required to craft those objects. Although warp cells/intermediate ingredients can be randomly awarded, making a warp cell each time is a massive turn off. I did find myself never having to worry about maintaining a supply of warp cells though, mid-game, but it does take a constant eye to ensure sufficient supply.Personal ProgressionPersonal progression becomes one of the main forms of motivation mid and late-game. Your exosuit, starship, and multi-tool all have inventory spaces (which can be upgraded) that can be outfitted with survival or combat functions. Vanity is also a factor in upgrading ships (you can buy and discover new ships to fly in) and multi-tools. Regarding the survival and combat functional upgrades (heat defense, mining speed, flight shields, etc.), every single one of them must be crafted from a blueprint, which must first be discovered or awarded. Furthermore, there are 4 levels of blueprints (base object, Sigma/Tau/Theta upgrade), and each blueprint can be discovered or awarded [/i]multiple times[/i]. Although it makes realistic sense that you will often find technology that you have previously âdiscovered,â the RNG needed to further your technology progress is so baffling. It would be a major service taking a step away from realism for a moment, or by implementing a method to choose which specific blueprints to learn, in order to improve the playersâ quality of life.Procedural GenerationEverything in NMS is procedurally generated, with the exception of scripted events. Planet topography/biomes, fauna anatomy, textures, random encounters, etc. Each planet will only have one biome though. Although it is very innovative and ambitious, the procedural generation still needs a lot of work. There is a lot of pop-in textures and on-the-spot rendering which truly detracts from the immersion, and the variety of textures and assets themselves are low enough to count. All outposts will use the same external structure assets (although the interior is really well done), and many creatures will look like they belong in the same family of circus oddities all because of this low amount of asset variety.âEnd-GameâAfter completing the Atlas path, the warp grind to the Center is truly unreal. Stacked warp drives/black holes will only net you ~1800 light years closer at best per jump/hole. At 177k light years from the center, post-Atlas Path, this is literally taking ages to complete. It's been 10 hours since I started the grind, after spending 22 hours completing the Atlas Path, and I've only covered 53k light years. My glacial progression is documented in my playlist below. Meanwhile, most people would feel that they have seen everything NMS had to offer at that point. The âendingâ/center of the galaxy is also extremely anti-climactic. With somewhat shallow gameplay (even with surprising moments) in between so many jumps, NMS is just destined to bleed players at some point.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo7FIDV19o4&index=1&list=PLeavCsRFiP5527-scGUys0BckcxmzRR05VerdictNMS currently feels like an Early Access title that is missing some vital game features, such as:Action-oriented scripted events: monster attack, freighter rescue, outpost/shelter defense, forced hazardous storm traversal, etc.Alien community interactions: with the player (massive trading centers/cities/governments), or between themselves (battles, war, true diplomatic relations).A profession system: space pirate, bounty hunter, farmer, galactic trader, etc. with rewards or perks more beneficial than generic currency (dialogue options, physical access, specific blueprints).A Quest & reward system: escort X, find X, hunt down X, convince X, catalogue X, weekly or daily challenges, etc. This will even promote deviation from the Atlas/Center paths; not having it included is a bit of a quandary.Many quality of life features: auto-craft warp cell, save on-command, upload all data, turn-off hold-down button presses, robust hints/tutorial system, skip animations, etc.In hindsight, if NMS was a $40 release, it would have been fair. Still a stretch for many people, but much easier to swallow than a full AAA title's normal asking price. Although I still enjoy certain aspects of the game, I just cannot recommend it to many people at its current state (regardless of poor PC performance) based on my gameplay perspective, unless a major sale strikes. If, and when, any new features (especially the ones listed above) are implemented that fundamentally changes the state of the âend-game,â I could easily see myself fully supporting NMS with my heart and soul. But until then, I would just move on and lament at what could have been.Before You Buy â analyses of newly released indie games"

Turns out I BSOD because I didn't accept the terms & conditions which were covered up by the game itself. For the whole 2 minutes I was actually playing the game it was very sluggish and had constant FPS drops. My rig is also overkill for most games I throw at it. It was also set to 30FPS by default.Now I can't start the game.UPDATE 13/08/2016: 5 re-installs didn't work. So I decided to install it to my SSD, it works now. Barely."

A  Procedurally generated universe  cannot kill the boredom created by repetition of gameplay. To make things worse, lots of the assets generated are largely the same. You can find the exact same type of plant(same mesh) with slight change of texture on almost every planets you travelled.NMS's space does not make you feel like space at all. There's no gas-giants. Every single planet has atmosphere for some reasons. Space stations are basically the same, inside and outside.To be fair, there are many loveable planets. But there's nothing to do apart from exploring and scanning.What's in the trailer is a completely different game, not the one we recieved from paying an AAA game price.With this price, you can buy Starbound and Spore, so that you can have two worlds to play on, WITH a huge amount of customizations, building, combat on TOP of EXPLORING and SCANNING. Former even allows multiplayer.While I did not encounter too many bugs and crashes, at this point, I cannot recommend the game to anyone until new features are added. Perhaps the game would have been benefitted a lot from Early Access."

The game cannot be considered finished since lots of stuff in the trailers are not appearing in the actual game at all. The team wanted to create miracle through randomness, but it just didn't work out. I'm ranting because I've waited so long and expected so much.

I really don't care about the game ending, I purchased this game because I really liked the idea of exploring with friends. Don't get me wrong, the game does the exploration part very well, however I cannot accept the lies the developers told us just for selling more copies of this game.

You start off with a wooden sword and pick and must 'upgrade' them with recipies you have to locate.* There's no pigs, cows, etc. Instead you find mutants of these forms randomly mashed togeather.* There are different biomes (types of planets), and all are unique (kinda), except like Minecraft, once you've seen one desert, you've seen them all no matter how varied the landscape is.* There's no end boss, and the ending is even wrose than Minecraft's. If you know Minecraft's ending, think that, but without any text.* The lore is about as shallow as a Minecraft Adventure map created by a 12 year old with two weeks of work.* No base building or redstone-like mechanics. That'd be silly in a survival/exploration game. Hahaha!Yanno, comparing it to even Minecraft is unfair, because Minecraft has the lego-like simplicity of user creation.Litterally, No Man's Sky is 100% about grinding to upgrade all your stuff for some of the worse plotline endings in gameing history.Otherwise, the only other appeal is travling around to see what the procedural generation can vomit up; *spoilers* (most of it looks like vomit).While from exploring blue solar system #4874 or pink solar system #252, it's extremely rare to find a nice looking planet. Pretty much all planets though cointain the game boring crap :  shelters ,  Observitories ,  Mololiths ,  Traders ,  Portals (that don't *^$&%%$ work) ,  Crashed Ships (No, not big ones, tiny player-pilotable ones you can trade out for) ..... Anddd... That's about all that comes to mind. I am sure there's a FEW more, but... Not many.I dislike the game because:* Boring* Mis-advertised with E3 content on Steam* Mis-advertised by Sean Murray* Boring* Crashed a ton upon launch after delays* Delays were to shoe-horn in the horrible  plot lines * Needed 2+ years more work* CRUSHING AMOUNTS OF LOST POTENTIAL* Boring* Horrible ship-to-ship figthing mechanics* No solar system map* No planetary map* BoringI liked the game because:* .... Some places (1 in 100) are pretty?* Space?* ....."

It is an endless grind, with very few things to do.  The game is enjoyable for some time, but quickly gets old. You basically fly to a slightly different planet and do the same thing each time.Maybe after a few mods have come out and players add the content the game will be where it should have been from the beginning.  My recommendation is to wait until this game goes on sale, which should be soon."

The entire gameplay video is literally fake. It's amazing that having that on your steam page isn't criminal. This game is a shell of what is shown in the trailers and videos. It's worth maybe $15-$20 at MOST. A 60 buck pricetag for this is actually laughable. I played for as long as I have because people insisted it gets better the closer you get to the center of the galaxy. After going through several black holes I found this to be false. The game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ indie beta passed off as a AAA title. Tried to get a refund around 7 hours of playtime but steam declined it. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You're just supporting a company that lied and cheated it's players into buying this garbage."

As some other reviews have said  It's a mile long, but on't an inch deep. pros:-biggest game ever-upgrading your gun/exosuit/ship can be fun-the way you interact with the aliens you meet is pretty enjoyablecons:-Flying is very lackluster and it's impossible to crash while on a planet, it's like there is an invisible wall about 30 feet above the surface of everything on the planet. Also landing is literally just pressing E... in a space game where landing on planets and surviving has a huge part, you can landanywhere at the click of a button...-can't look around your cockpit without a gamepad, you're stuck looking wherever your ship is facing.-the universe feels completely dead and unihabited despite there being trade outposts and a few observatories here and there, along with some giant cargo ships that just jump in and do... literally nothing, they just sit in space.-after about the 18 hour mark my multitool was extremely overpowered-basically no challenging enemies to fight, all of them die very quickly-The weather despawns when you go inside so it's a bit awkward when you hear rain hitting the roof but look out the window and see clear skies. This also happens when you enter a cave which looks really really bad. overall I'd give this game like a 6/10. It's not awful and has some good things in it, but it's not worth 60$"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 26, 2016              I was very impressed with this game originally. Finally, a game that offers the space aspect I was dreaming of, and a very cool concept. About 24 hours of gameplay in, and only a few planets in, I already found I had maxed out the upgrade slots to my exosuit, I maxed out the tech upgrades for The ship, multi tool and suit, explored hundreds of areas, only to find every planet was a retexture and remix of the same plant types, some with specalized plants, but still lower verity then I was expecting. The next 24 hours of game play I find myself just working towards a better ship, and discovering there isnt really much more to this game then a space flight, basic crafting, exploration (and ecological identification) game. The item listing amounts for avalable resorces is also shockingly small. It appears minecraft may offer more items in total.I loved this game but it was not what I expected at all. For this price, I expected so much more from this game. Honestly after seeing what I have, I would not have bought this game. I feel anything over $20 would actually be overpriced. Its a very interesting concept but the developers just arnt there yet. It seems they released it before it was truly ready, or they just wanted a cash grab based on the hype. Maybe both. I hope perhaps they might update the game and fix the obvious flaws within the game, as it does not have enough content to warrent the nearly $70 price tag. It has enough content to occupy you until you can no longer return it and realize what the game actually is. A nice looking space trading, exploration, flight and crafting game. And a bunch of failed promises."

I don't know what exactly they had polished in those 2 months, but from my point of view it sounds like nothing that was advertised was working properly so they removed it leaving this pathetic excuse of a game for us to deal with.And the biggest problem is that Steam still uses out of date promotional videos and screenshots. This is an outrageous lie.. you really cheat your potential customers with this.I wouldn't recommend buying this game, not even as a gift for your enemies!"

The fact they no longer advertise the game as Multiplayer on this very site just proves they're trying to cover it up.The fact steam has to disclaim there will be no special exemptions to refund this game is self-explanatory. Its a $%#@ DISGRACE! I pre-ordered this game on the hope that what we had seen was only a speck of sand in comparison to the amazing scope this game could accomplish.At first I loved the art style and the adventure that awaited before I got off my first planet thrilled me. It was not long before it became a drag and I was rinsing and repeating the same thing over and over again.I still had hope and after jumping through multiple black holes crossing who knows how far in distance it was clear to me that whatever lay waiting at the end wasn't worth it.This isn't like going to the movies and not enjoying the film, this is like buying a fake painting.You can like this game for whatever reason but you can not come forward and tell me that they didn't lie to us and promise us something else. In my country I have the right to get a refund if a product isn't as advertised (Australian Consumer Law). Steam decides to completely ignore my support complaints so my only alternative is to sue someone.Were I not facing a very expensive trial I would without a doubt do so. The only thing i can do is give this miserly thumbs down and tell you to not make the same mistake I did and spend your well earned money or in my case my birthday money on this wreck of a game..."

Once you have completed the first planet you have pretty much experienced the whole game, unless you want to do it all over again on a different color planet.  And even the grinding of mineral hunting is simple, just wait a bit, watch some tv and the minerals grow right back.  I played and played, hoping for something more, i waited on patches.  But it is still terribly disappointing.  An worst of all Steam wont give a refund, stupid 2 hour rule.  The first 10 hours you are running and mining and scanning and hopeful.  It's after that when you realize that is all there is to the game.  Maybe this is just a sign that Steam is only in it for the money too just like the no mans sky game makers"

Horrible horrible game, mods won't even save this.UPDATE: NEXTThis game has some improvements.  Is it now  worth a buy ? NO.  Seriously NO.It is such a constant mindless grind.  All you ever do is grind, move inventory items around, grind, use inventory, grind, fly, land, grind. There is never anything rewarding.  EVER.  This is not enjoyable."

After logging 26 hours I have to give up. The game is so far from what was told on the web and in the media by the developers that it borders to beeing a scam. And movies and pictures in Steam donÂ´t even represent the real gameplay."

I started off like  Oh this is pretty cool got to repair my ship.  It seemed fairly promising, but it quickly became very repetitive. Almost every planet is BORING, I have only come across one planet (a snow one) that was genuinely intersting and cool. But other than that every thing has felt almost exactly the same. In the trailers and screenshots they show these amazing planets and environments, but I have yet to experience any of it. So now I find that about 7 hours in I am already bored and see no reason to keep playing. BUT, mods seems like they could be what this game needs so I will keep an ear to the ground and wait. Hopefully, they can save this game. As of now this game is definitely not worth the $60 price tag, if you are considering buying it DON'T. Hold off until either a price drop or if the modding community picks up the slack of the developers."

Also, going forward, be cautious about buying anything from Hello Games."

It's a grind.You'll enjoy the first 10-15 hours of the game exploring the new planets and travelling throughout the universe where is there 14 quintillion planets, however you ask you self a question if theres any point disocvering 20 planets as they get repetetetive and boring. Yes the game is about exploration but some planets are not even worth exploring. Everything becomes really repetetive, the builidings you see, the ships you come across, the planets and the grind which does pay off in the long term if you really want to go and visit the centre of the universe. (I've my self not been to the centre of the universe, but i don't really see a point beacuse in theory there's no centre of the universe.) There are of course some positives to the game such as, space battles and encountering different life forms living on different planet that are  generated , going through blackholes, and the aesthetic look of the game although it doesn't really look much like the 2014 E3 gameplay trailer. I do enjoy the game, but i do not recommend it.I'm still hoping for multiplayer and a lot of the bug fixies likes falling through the face of the planet that I've encountered plenty of times.I hope you find this somewhat helpful.Â¬Nuruk"

As i've heard others say, an ocean of content to explore but its all only an inch deep. Then to make it all worse i left it on overnight and since i left it run i can't even get my money back for this even after i tried to post a response with steam. I would recommend avoiding this game at all costs unless you want to pay AAA prices for disappointment."

Then you'll spend the rest of your time hoping that you didn't waste $60, wanting as hard as you can to believe that the features promised are actually in the game.  But they aren't.  And after a few more hours you'll realize that you've been swindled.This game would have been fine for a $20 price tag if the developers had been honest about what all the game had to offer.  But as it stands it's a game the size of the universe with the depth and complexity of a piece of paper.  Don't let the trailers or screenshots of the game on Steam fool you, that is NOT what the game is and most of the features have been completely cut or were never there to begin with.  I'm ashamed that Steam even lets that kind of false advertisement stay up on their store, to be honest.TL;DR: The game is a rip-off and doesn't deliver on most of the promises it has.  Fun for the first few planets until you realize that they're all the same.  Like watching a random number generator with pretty graphics."

Just like the ending of the game, a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. (didnt play to that point, youtubed)If you judge the game by what it is, and not by what was promissed, the first few hours of discovery are ok, since you know nothing and expect to be amazed, but, very rapidly you start noticing that you are doing the same things over and over, and, as the time goes by, you realize that there is nothing more to it.There are so many hours in my account, but, its because everything in this game is slow, some were leaving the game open due frustation, and some by letting some other people run around to experience the failure (like, yeah, go, try finding something interesting) and stuff like that.There so many bad things on this game, like being design for the ps4 and lazily exported to pc, the ps4 limitations like in the rendering distances and...naa, it sucks my energy just to think about it, â¥â¥â¥â¥ thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ This is another example of why pc gamers bash consoles, their mere existance degrades games that could be better if were written with pc in mind.Personally, I never going to buy anything from hello games again, ( fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me ) and, also, nothing that sean murray ever touches."

Somehow, I must transform all the disappointment my expectation has evolved to into something meaningful that - hopefully - will be read and perhaps help improve the game eventually.Ok, so... First and foremost: Is it a good game? Yes - it's a good game overall. As a game alone it's average, however, only pulled up because as a feat it is incredible. That's not enough for all the promise and the hype around No Man's Sky, though. It should have been AMAZING. It should've been breathtaking, it should have been ground shaking. And don't come to me with all that pseudo-indie false modesty  Oh, we didn't expect such hype! ,  Oh, we didn't expect such buzz. .YOU DID. No one publishes their game through SONY and charge an AAA-Title price without expecting that. No one releases big event trailers on E3 and whatnot, no one gives interviews claiming to be creating the most massive and diverse universe ever if they're not expecting great things. What were you expecting? A Newgrounds cover? lol.So, that said... I can't blame Hello Games entirely because we all know that if the development of this game was fueled by their dreams alone, it would have been what it always promised to be. But, oh well, people gotta eat, SONY has schedules and all that. So... well, whatever. We can't rush art, I guess, and every day a new game is proving that.Anyway, let's get on with what's important. NO, I'm not going to complain about Multiplayer support. I NEVER even cared about that and I've always understood NMS as a sci-fi, exploration game. My gripes reside elsewhere:No Man's Sky is a big lie. Actually, a farse. Yes, that's a good word. No Man's Sky is a huge, expertly crafted farse.Because they've given us a vast universe with 18 quintillion planets, all different from each other and incredibly beautiful in their unique ways... BUT they've also chained us to a repetitive, uncreative and boring journey of doing the same things and going to the same places over and over.And that's why I've started this review with the line  No Man's Sky might be the greatest paradox in the history of video games. So, from my point of view, it's bad design. Let me explain why:Pretty much everything you do to  move around  - whether flying or on the ground - requires specific resources. You need isotopes for Hazard protection and Life Support, for the launch thrusters (that can only launch you 4 times (!!) before needing a recharge), Thamium9 for your warp engine (that allows you to travel between orbital bodies in far less than 5 or so days, the time you would usually need in  Normal speed ) and, of course, a complex fuel made with several crafted components like Antimatter for your Hyperdrive - what allows you to travel through the stars.That's all fine and dandy, I don't mind having to collect resources and all that. It can be fun and it is, after all, a space exploration game. Problem is: it IS a game. And being a game, it can't let the player make a mistake and get stranded on a planet or in space forever.And the game won't let that happen... their solution? PEPPER THESE RESOURCES EVERYWHERE.And this is the first big mistake in No Man's Sky. What was supposed to feel like an immersive, colossal living universe fails to do so because there will be red crystals (Plutonium) everywhere. Planets might be different, but hey, look, tons of red crystals as usual.And in space, there are asteroids everywhere. EVERYWHERE. You know, to make sure you won't run out of Thamium9. There's no  clear  space. Every single cubic meter of space is filled with asteroids, you feel like you're eternally lost in an asteroid field.So... if these resources are available everywhere, my question is: why are they needed at all? This is stupid design. You need fuel for the launch thrusters, but there's plutonium everywhere. You need Thamium9, but there are asteroids everywhere. So what should've been a survival challenge or a logistics side of the game  ok, I must not waste fuel because it's not easy to find it here!  becomes a stupid chore.  Oh, launch thruster is empty again, let me hop out and blast a crystal. It completely ruins the immersion and all that. Everywhere looks the same, every place needs those damn Plutonium crystals, the asteroids, the big Heridium columns (needed for Hyperdrive stuff), etc.This should all be gone. All these stupid requirements - launch thruster fuel, warp engine fuel - should all be gone. They ruin the game. The only fuel that has actual purpose and is nice to work on acquiring is the Hyperdrive fuel.Take Starbound as an example - AND YES, I'M GOING TO COMPARE THIS WITH STARBOUND BECAUSE THAT GAME IS BRILLIANT - You can freely travel around a star system without consuming fuel. Fuel is only required for interstellar travel. So it can be confined in moons, and allow you to have ACTUALLY diverse planets without the same red crystals and blue plants and huge heridium columns everywhere.Yeah.Ok, and now my second complain:Imagine Assassin's Creed on a galactic scale. I'm saying Assassin's Creed, but I could be mentioning most open world games where you have  repetitive  tasks around the world to achieve certain purposes. In Assassin's Creed, you have to climb high places to  synchronize  the map. These are EVERYWHERE.Well, NMS is a victim of that as well. And here the paradox continues: just scrap the 18 quintillion planets. They're all different  masks  for the same shelters. The same trading stations. The same Drop Pods. The same Ruins. The same... well, everything. The whole planet surface is sprinkled with hundreds of the same things. IN EVERY PLANET.Just look at that guy that completely upgraded his suit and his ship to  max level  without leaving the starter planet. Why? Because:1- You just need to repeat an activity to  Upgrade  something. For example, to upgrade your Exosuit slots, you just need to find a drop pod and pay a fee.2- Planets are huge.3- So, in one single planet there is enough space for a lot of the same event/activity to spawn - henceforth enough space for you to achieve everything you can (in terms of improvement) without ever reaching space.This is just...Oh, damn. I don't even know how to put it. It's just stupid.Everywhere is all the same. A lot of asteroids, a space station (all the same interiors, little changes), some potted-plant stealing to talk to the alien (because you need carbon which is available RIGHT THERE - ONCE AGAIN THAT PROBLEM, WHY ASK US RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE? JUST TO WASTE TIME, THAT'S WHY.) then you land on a planet, find the same shelters, the same structures, the same ruins, the same... everything.HOW CAN I BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT IN A GAME WITH 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS?There must be a point in history where they messed up. Seriously. How did they EVEN MANAGE to make a game this huge repetitive?!?Anyway...(Sorry, this is pretty much an angry review)Last but not least, the cerry on the top of the farse:YOU DO NOT DISCOVER ANYTHING. To go beyond anyone else has ever been ?  To challenge the frontiers of space ?  To boldly go-- nah, nah, nah, nah.Nope.No, nada.You don't discover ANYTHING, because EVERYWHERE you go is already CROWDED with alien spaceports, shelters, stations... In fact, you're the biggest bully in the universe, going around RENAMING planets, stars and creatures that other species already met and all that. HOW RUDE!But yeah, there's simply no freaking place in the universe that has not been visited by antisocial aliens (because there's never two or more of them together, have you noticed that?)...That's it.Shame, Hello Games.PS: the TINY distance between planets is also ridiculous.  Star systems ? lol, bite me."

I don't even know how to put it. It's just stupid.Everywhere is all the same. A lot of asteroids, a space station (all the same interiors, little changes), some potted-plant stealing to talk to the alien (because you need carbon which is available RIGHT THERE - ONCE AGAIN THAT PROBLEM, WHY ASK US RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE? JUST TO WASTE TIME, THAT'S WHY.) then you land on a planet, find the same shelters, the same structures, the same ruins, the same... everything.HOW CAN I BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT IN A GAME WITH 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS?There must be a point in history where they messed up. Seriously. How did they EVEN MANAGE to make a game this huge repetitive?!?Anyway...(Sorry, this is pretty much an angry review)Last but not least, the cerry on the top of the farse:YOU DO NOT DISCOVER ANYTHING. To go beyond anyone else has ever been ?  To challenge the frontiers of space ?  To boldly go-- nah, nah, nah, nah.Nope.No, nada.You don't discover ANYTHING, because EVERYWHERE you go is already CROWDED with alien spaceports, shelters, stations... In fact, you're the biggest bully in the universe, going around RENAMING planets, stars and creatures that other species already met and all that. HOW RUDE!But yeah, there's simply no freaking place in the universe that has not been visited by antisocial aliens (because there's never two or more of them together, have you noticed that?)...That's it.Shame, Hello Games.PS: the TINY distance between planets is also ridiculous.  Star systems ? lol, bite me."

Just like the ending of the game, a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. (didnt play to that point, youtubed)If you judge the game by what it is, and not by what was promissed, the first few hours of discovery are ok, since you know nothing and expect to be amazed, but, very rapidly you start noticing that you are doing the same things over and over, and, as the time goes by, you realize that there is nothing more to it.There are so many hours in my account, but, its because everything in this game is slow, some were leaving the game open due frustation, and some by letting some other people run around to experience the failure (like, yeah, go, try finding something interesting) and stuff like that.There so many bad things on this game, like being design for the ps4 and lazily exported to pc, the ps4 limitations like in the rendering distances and...naa, it sucks my energy just to think about it, â¥â¥â¥â¥ thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ This is another example of why pc gamers bash consoles, their mere existance degrades games that could be better if were written with pc in mind.Personally, I never going to buy anything from hello games again, ( fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me ) and, also, nothing that sean murray ever touches."

My laptop (Alienware 17r3 with a 6th Gen i7-6700HQ, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, 8 GB of GDDR5 Nvidia 980M) had huge framerate issues with the game and would even crash despite drivers being updated and everything else being in place. For comparison, my Alienware runs Rise of The Tombraider (ROTR) flawlessly (with DirectX12 at ultra settings) AT 220+ FPS!!!!I've been a loyal Steam-er all my gaming-life and never before have I seen such a hyped game failing to deliver all it promised! I'm disappointed because Hello Games have been overhyping the game's dynamics. Steam, quit promoting such a game!1) There ended up being no landing on asteroids. There's no way to destroy freighters or space stations, and  fleets  in the game are comprised of maybe three or so ships. Freighters also do not move at all, despite their engines always being on. All of these things make the game much more static and lifeless than we were shown.2) Sean talked a lot about how you could have a significant standing with factions that would meaningfully effect the game world. This is not the case, the serve nearly no purpose at all from what I can tell. They open up a few options for things like shield and health recharges, neither of which you would ever actually need them to do for multiple reasons. You can also farm words from their languages at a certain point, but it hardly seems like Hello Games meant for this. You can max out faction rep in your first play session, and there are only three ranks for each. Losing rank seems very hard to do, even if you're trying to do it.3) Factions don't seem to have any interactions with each other at all, let alone have giant space battles.4) There are no ringed planets, and no sand planets. Ringed planets were only talked about, but sand planets were on display multiple times. Considering planets look very samey in the game, who knows how much variety has been cut. There seems to only be typical out-of-bounds void outside of solar systems, so there's no way to travel out of them to other systems manually. If you go far enough out, things start bugging out, and your game will crash eventually.4) Planets do not rotate on their axis, moons do not orbit their planets, and planets do not orbit a sun. To quote someone else,  There isn't even a sun, it's just decoration on the sky box .The reasons for requesting refund are endless! I've filed a request for refund owing to Hello Games' not being able to keep their pre-release promises."

Somehow, I must transform all the disappointment my expectation has evolved to into something meaningful that - hopefully - will be read and perhaps help improve the game eventually.Ok, so... First and foremost: Is it a good game? Yes - it's a good game overall. As a game alone it's average, however, only pulled up because as a feat it is incredible. That's not enough for all the promise and the hype around No Man's Sky, though. It should have been AMAZING. It should've been breathtaking, it should have been ground shaking. And don't come to me with all that pseudo-indie false modesty  Oh, we didn't expect such hype! ,  Oh, we didn't expect such buzz. .YOU DID. No one publishes their game through SONY and charge an AAA-Title price without expecting that. No one releases big event trailers on E3 and whatnot, no one gives interviews claiming to be creating the most massive and diverse universe ever if they're not expecting great things. What were you expecting? A Newgrounds cover? lol.So, that said... I can't blame Hello Games entirely because we all know that if the development of this game was fueled by their dreams alone, it would have been what it always promised to be. But, oh well, people gotta eat, SONY has schedules and all that. So... well, whatever. We can't rush art, I guess, and every day a new game is proving that.Anyway, let's get on with what's important. NO, I'm not going to complain about Multiplayer support. I NEVER even cared about that and I've always understood NMS as a sci-fi, exploration game. My gripes reside elsewhere:No Man's Sky is a big lie. Actually, a farse. Yes, that's a good word. No Man's Sky is a huge, expertly crafted farse.Because they've given us a vast universe with 18 quintillion planets, all different from each other and incredibly beautiful in their unique ways... BUT they've also chained us to a repetitive, uncreative and boring journey of doing the same things and going to the same places over and over.And that's why I've started this review with the line  No Man's Sky might be the greatest paradox in the history of video games. So, from my point of view, it's bad design. Let me explain why:Pretty much everything you do to  move around  - whether flying or on the ground - requires specific resources. You need isotopes for Hazard protection and Life Support, for the launch thrusters (that can only launch you 4 times (!!) before needing a recharge), Thamium9 for your warp engine (that allows you to travel between orbital bodies in far less than 5 or so days, the time you would usually need in  Normal speed ) and, of course, a complex fuel made with several crafted components like Antimatter for your Hyperdrive - what allows you to travel through the stars.That's all fine and dandy, I don't mind having to collect resources and all that. It can be fun and it is, after all, a space exploration game. Problem is: it IS a game. And being a game, it can't let the player make a mistake and get stranded on a planet or in space forever.And the game won't let that happen... their solution? PEPPER THESE RESOURCES EVERYWHERE.And this is the first big mistake in No Man's Sky. What was supposed to feel like an immersive, colossal living universe fails to do so because there will be red crystals (Plutonium) everywhere. Planets might be different, but hey, look, tons of red crystals as usual.And in space, there are asteroids everywhere. EVERYWHERE. You know, to make sure you won't run out of Thamium9. There's no  clear  space. Every single cubic meter of space is filled with asteroids, you feel like you're eternally lost in an asteroid field.So... if these resources are available everywhere, my question is: why are they needed at all? This is stupid design. You need fuel for the launch thrusters, but there's plutonium everywhere. You need Thamium9, but there are asteroids everywhere. So what should've been a survival challenge or a logistics side of the game  ok, I must not waste fuel because it's not easy to find it here!  becomes a stupid chore.  Oh, launch thruster is empty again, let me hop out and blast a crystal. It completely ruins the immersion and all that. Everywhere looks the same, every place needs those damn Plutonium crystals, the asteroids, the big Heridium columns (needed for Hyperdrive stuff), etc.This should all be gone. All these stupid requirements - launch thruster fuel, warp engine fuel - should all be gone. They ruin the game. The only fuel that has actual purpose and is nice to work on acquiring is the Hyperdrive fuel.Take Starbound as an example - AND YES, I'M GOING TO COMPARE THIS WITH STARBOUND BECAUSE THAT GAME IS BRILLIANT - You can freely travel around a star system without consuming fuel. Fuel is only required for interstellar travel. So it can be confined in moons, and allow you to have ACTUALLY diverse planets without the same red crystals and blue plants and huge heridium columns everywhere.Yeah.Ok, and now my second complain:Imagine Assassin's Creed on a galactic scale. I'm saying Assassin's Creed, but I could be mentioning most open world games where you have  repetitive  tasks around the world to achieve certain purposes. In Assassin's Creed, you have to climb high places to  synchronize  the map. These are EVERYWHERE.Well, NMS is a victim of that as well. And here the paradox continues: just scrap the 18 quintillion planets. They're all different  masks  for the same shelters. The same trading stations. The same Drop Pods. The same Ruins. The same... well, everything. The whole planet surface is sprinkled with hundreds of the same things. IN EVERY PLANET.Just look at that guy that completely upgraded his suit and his ship to  max level  without leaving the starter planet. Why? Because:1- You just need to repeat an activity to  Upgrade  something. For example, to upgrade your Exosuit slots, you just need to find a drop pod and pay a fee.2- Planets are huge.3- So, in one single planet there is enough space for a lot of the same event/activity to spawn - henceforth enough space for you to achieve everything you can (in terms of improvement) without ever reaching space.This is just...Oh, damn. I don't even know how to put it. It's just stupid.Everywhere is all the same. A lot of asteroids, a space station (all the same interiors, little changes), some potted-plant stealing to talk to the alien (because you need carbon which is available RIGHT THERE - ONCE AGAIN THAT PROBLEM, WHY ASK US RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE? JUST TO WASTE TIME, THAT'S WHY.) then you land on a planet, find the same shelters, the same structures, the same ruins, the same... everything.HOW CAN I BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT IN A GAME WITH 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS?There must be a point in history where they messed up. Seriously. How did they EVEN MANAGE to make a game this huge repetitive?!?Anyway...(Sorry, this is pretty much an angry review)Last but not least, the cerry on the top of the farse:YOU DO NOT DISCOVER ANYTHING. To go beyond anyone else has ever been ?  To challenge the frontiers of space ?  To boldly go-- nah, nah, nah, nah.Nope.No, nada.You don't discover ANYTHING, because EVERYWHERE you go is already CROWDED with alien spaceports, shelters, stations... In fact, you're the biggest bully in the universe, going around RENAMING planets, stars and creatures that other species already met and all that. HOW RUDE!But yeah, there's simply no freaking place in the universe that has not been visited by antisocial aliens (because there's never two or more of them together, have you noticed that?)...That's it.Shame, Hello Games.PS: the TINY distance between planets is also ridiculous.

PEPPER THESE RESOURCES EVERYWHERE.And this is the first big mistake in No Man's Sky. What was supposed to feel like an immersive, colossal living universe fails to do so because there will be red crystals (Plutonium) everywhere. Planets might be different, but hey, look, tons of red crystals as usual.And in space, there are asteroids everywhere. EVERYWHERE. You know, to make sure you won't run out of Thamium9. There's no  clear  space. Every single cubic meter of space is filled with asteroids, you feel like you're eternally lost in an asteroid field.So... if these resources are available everywhere, my question is: why are they needed at all? This is stupid design. You need fuel for the launch thrusters, but there's plutonium everywhere. You need Thamium9, but there are asteroids everywhere. So what should've been a survival challenge or a logistics side of the game  ok, I must not waste fuel because it's not easy to find it here!  becomes a stupid chore.  Oh, launch thruster is empty again, let me hop out and blast a crystal. It completely ruins the immersion and all that. Everywhere looks the same, every place needs those damn Plutonium crystals, the asteroids, the big Heridium columns (needed for Hyperdrive stuff), etc.This should all be gone. All these stupid requirements - launch thruster fuel, warp engine fuel - should all be gone. They ruin the game. The only fuel that has actual purpose and is nice to work on acquiring is the Hyperdrive fuel.Take Starbound as an example - AND YES, I'M GOING TO COMPARE THIS WITH STARBOUND BECAUSE THAT GAME IS BRILLIANT - You can freely travel around a star system without consuming fuel. Fuel is only required for interstellar travel. So it can be confined in moons, and allow you to have ACTUALLY diverse planets without the same red crystals and blue plants and huge heridium columns everywhere.Yeah.Ok, and now my second complain:Imagine Assassin's Creed on a galactic scale. I'm saying Assassin's Creed, but I could be mentioning most open world games where you have  repetitive  tasks around the world to achieve certain purposes. In Assassin's Creed, you have to climb high places to  synchronize  the map. These are EVERYWHERE.Well, NMS is a victim of that as well. And here the paradox continues: just scrap the 18 quintillion planets. They're all different  masks  for the same shelters. The same trading stations. The same Drop Pods. The same Ruins. The same... well, everything. The whole planet surface is sprinkled with hundreds of the same things. IN EVERY PLANET.Just look at that guy that completely upgraded his suit and his ship to  max level  without leaving the starter planet. Why? Because:1- You just need to repeat an activity to  Upgrade  something. For example, to upgrade your Exosuit slots, you just need to find a drop pod and pay a fee.2- Planets are huge.3- So, in one single planet there is enough space for a lot of the same event/activity to spawn - henceforth enough space for you to achieve everything you can (in terms of improvement) without ever reaching space.This is just...Oh, damn. I don't even know how to put it. It's just stupid.Everywhere is all the same. A lot of asteroids, a space station (all the same interiors, little changes), some potted-plant stealing to talk to the alien (because you need carbon which is available RIGHT THERE - ONCE AGAIN THAT PROBLEM, WHY ASK US RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE? JUST TO WASTE TIME, THAT'S WHY.) then you land on a planet, find the same shelters, the same structures, the same ruins, the same... everything.HOW CAN I BE COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT IN A GAME WITH 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS?There must be a point in history where they messed up. Seriously. How did they EVEN MANAGE to make a game this huge repetitive?!?Anyway...(Sorry, this is pretty much an angry review)Last but not least, the cerry on the top of the farse:YOU DO NOT DISCOVER ANYTHING. To go beyond anyone else has ever been ?  To challenge the frontiers of space ?  To boldly go-- nah, nah, nah, nah.Nope.No, nada.You don't discover ANYTHING, because EVERYWHERE you go is already CROWDED with alien spaceports, shelters, stations... In fact, you're the biggest bully in the universe, going around RENAMING planets, stars and creatures that other species already met and all that. HOW RUDE!But yeah, there's simply no freaking place in the universe that has not been visited by antisocial aliens (because there's never two or more of them together, have you noticed that?)...That's it.Shame, Hello Games.PS: the TINY distance between planets is also ridiculous.  Star systems ? lol, bite me."

From multiplayer to space battles we were given a gutted shell of a game. I only wanted this game to play with friends and low and behold that wasn't a feature that was given to us. Even though in an interview with Sean Murray he clearly states that multiplayer and even Griefing was a possibility but nope. That is nowhere to be seen in the end product.  Don't buy, plain and simple. You won't get what was promised."

Also, it is very buggy; Game crashes randomly, sometimes low fps, If game minimized it will not come back up. The list is almost endeless. I defenitely do hope they fix the game especially since 60 dollars was paid; unfortunatley the game is not where it needs to be, or atleast what they promised the game to be."

I can't tell you how much respect I have for Hello Games and Sean Murray to have such inspiration and dedication to this game even after all theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥people over the internet gives them. That's why i've been with the community and HG since launch because I believed in this project..There's HUGE potential in this game and I can't wait for the future of the game. These updates, old and the one's coming, are a true example how to resurrect a game from the ground up closer to the heavens with every single update, not to forget Waking Titan with the ARG's and all. (If you want information you should google about Waking Titan NMS)  HG will always have their dedicated fans supporting them including me and I hope that a lot of you people give these guys another chance with an open mind and not based on what you've heard about the launch or hate speeches about the game. I absolutely recommend this game .. Hello Games isn't giving up easily to get all of you to change your minds about NMS and I adore that!Will update the review more after decent amount of time with NEXT"

The rebalance in this patch requires you to run around (and fly, and take-off, and land) a lot more after fuel, which make things even worse than it originally was.Maybe in 6 or more months the game will be worth some fraction of its price.-This is a review by a non-crusader, non-hater, non-fanboy, who finished the game. I think you can consider me a hardcore fan of space, sandbox and open-world/exploration games.Do not buy this UNLESS you're a hardcore fan of one of the genres. Do not buy this expecting good story, lore, or a good ending. Do not buy this expecting anything at all. Your best bet is to wait for a sale and a ton of patches.The issue that makes No Man's Sky so hard to review for media outlets and the like, is that it takes a lot of hours for you to notice all of the shortcomings and problems with the game. It took me 10 hours to realize it wasn't as good as most people were saying, 20 hours to realize the game wouldn't evolve past the initial activities you perform at the first hours on the game, and 30 hours to realize that, gameplay-wise, the game feels like it was designed by game design students for some assignment.I love procgen, I play a ton of indie and underground games which feature it - like Dwarf Fortress, my favorite game of all time - but the issue with procgen is that it will only provide infinite scenarios, objects, npcs, and things like that. Even though that can sound exciting, it won't take long for you to realize that what makes a procgen game amazing is the meaning it attributes to the stuff it randomly generates.Example: in NMS, you have NPC ships and freighters flying around. They do nothing, they are nothing, they change nothing. They came from nowhere and aren't going anywhere. That Space-Station you just saw has no meaning and makes no difference, just like the last 70 you flew by on your way to the Galactic Core.Sean Murray was my personal hero for these last 3 years, but he bit more than he could chew..and he probably can't even apologize for the game's flaws, issues and incompleteness because he has a contract with Sony. Hello Games hasn't even commented on the missing multiplayer component yet, wanna guess why?This is Spore 2: Overloaded.In Conclusion (or TL;DR): Unless you're a hardcore fan, or you have money lying around and absolutely nothing else to play, or if you just want a chill game that costs as much as an AAA game with less depth and worse game design than freeware games, be my guest. Everyone is streaming and talking about it, it's probably good...right?"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 17, 2017              I made a bit of a rant review with a thumbs down after the big NEXT update, because I lost all the work I had put in to the game. I was however finally after 8 hours of frustration (searching for a tiny unmarked base station) able to restore my old save game. If I would not have been able to play from my old save then I probably would have uninstalled the game to never play it again. It sounds like I am over reacting, but the most tedius boring grind of the game is in the first 50 hours of the game. Everything is locked away in the game and they made an excessive grind for you to complete through quests and general gameplay, before you really can start having fun in the game. I simply did not and still don't want to repeat that ever again!So now with my old stuff intact I am trying the update out for a few days and I am having fun again. I like most new stuff in the update even though it was a lot of changes to take in. In the beginning I was not a fan of the new resources refining, but it actually makes sense and it has it's benefits.Multiplayer feature is I hope experimental, because at this point it feels very bare bones and unfinished. You don't actually meet other players in this huge universe, but they connect to you from the starting screen. It is not an MMO setup like EVE where you always have players around you on an external server, the other player is local on your connection only. And at this point I don't think you want to run in randoms anyway due to the griefing reports that are already coming in. So I have the online mode off for now till I am at a point where I can deal with those little griefers with OP weapons and stuff.Graphics and AI have been improved alot and also the terrain is not glitchy anymore. I used to have some occasional terrain texture glitches, but it is all smooth now. The terrain also looks a bit more diverse generated, but that might be a placebo effect :)So yeah, I am giving the game a thumb up again. You do need to expect an excessive grind in the early game stage though and bite through that before the game starts to get fun and you have more freedom in the game. And do keep a back up of your save after the innitial grind, because stuff happens when they do a big update."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 13, 2016              No Man's Sky is tough for me to review. On one hand I had always wanted a 'Earth-to-Space' FPS which this delivers on. On the other, I had never considered what I would do when I finally played - and the developers certainly didn't either. Much like my first girlfriend, it took me far too long to realise that what I was enjoying was a shallow mish mash of things I had always wanted to play with but overall was not good for me in any long term sense.Am I salty that I dropped 60 bucks on this? No, I've spent far more money on far less - so I can only put that down to me being bad with money. Does that mean that HG deserved my 60? Also no. I am going to not recommend this game purely because of the price and to let them understand that what they did was wrong. If you can get this game for $15 or less, then go for it."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 22, 2016              Don't believe the Store videos and screenshots. You can't do or see most of it.At this point, I cannot recommend No Manâs Sky. Before I explain why, I would like to point out that I am aware of the numerous allegations false advertising and missing content that have come to light since NMSâs release. I will do my best in this review to discuss only the content that is in the game, rather than what was promised. I will discuss the positive aspects of the game and work my way out from there.No Manâs Sky is a survival sim revolving around you using a small spaceship to locate planets, explore them, and harvest resources from them to build and fuel your various technologies.I find No Manâs Sky to be beautiful. I started on a red planet with Zendikar-style floating islands beneath a striking purple sky.  Bioluminescent plants and resource crystals glowed and shimmered around me. Small prey animals chirped with fright if I came too close and scuttled away though the brush. Ancient and ominous-looking alien constructs beg you to investigate them. Performance-wise, I have been free of the issues that plague many.  My GTX 960 and 8GB of ram push the game along at a rock-solid 60fps.Your inventory and your shipâs inventory are both very small. Basic resources, crafted items, and quality-of-life upgrades all occupy valuable slots in your inventory. This is actually a good thing. It forces the player to think about what they are trying to accomplish and place a real value on every object they choose to make or acquire. This is an important decision-making element in an otherwise unchallenging game.Things start to deteriorate when I discuss exploration. Your avatar walks at a snailâs pace and can only sprint for ten seconds before a rest period is needed. Learning to use your jetpack to its fullest extent is a must. Flying your spaceship (which is what drew me to the game) is a mixed bag. In the dozens of times Iâve taken off, Iâve invariably been a little excited by the shipâs willingness to leap into the air. Landing is a simple automated task. Your first burn to leave a planetâs atmosphere will be a thrill. Seeing your second planet loom large as you fly directly at it, moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light is legitimately harrowing. It is a treat to fly to one of the mile-long freighters and skim the surface of its hull. Too bad you cannot do that with a planetâs terrain. Roughly fifty meters above the surface, the game forbids you from descending or pitching the nose of your ship down. The only way to go lower is to land. The planetsâ have varied terrain: narrow canyons beg to be flown in and oceans ask to be skimmed. All that fun is very much in sight and the game forbids you from having it.The ships themselves come in a dozen varieties or so. At least thatâs what Iâve seen in the six hours Iâve been playing. NPCs in the game are happy to sell you theirs if you have the money. Donât get too worked up about that: the only meaningful difference between the ship types is the number of slots they carry. Otherwise, they fly at much the same speed and have the same turning radiuses. It is a letdown to think of how cool the ships could have been. I imagine applying the Borderlands gun-generation system to the ships: randomized hulls, engines, wings, etc. would have been amazing.  The last nail in the spaceship coffin is the fact that you cannot rename your own ship.The aliens you meet face-to-face in the game are static. They will all be found sitting in their offices and living spaces, tapping at fancy-looking tablet computers, waiting for you to come by and talk to them.  If you guess the correct dialogue response, they will teach you a word of their language (which makes future interactions easier); give you an upgrade blueprint; or hand you a new multitool. The AI pirate ships exhibit unimpressive, but aggressive behavior and come loaded for bear. They will strip away your shipâs shields and chew up your hull without the least mercy.  How you remedy the loss of shields is dreadful. You need to go into your inventory mid-dogfight and use the gameâs horrid user interface to repair your shields with isotopes in your inventory. This process takes several seconds where the game is not paused and you cannot maneuver to evade the enemy.The crafting element of NMS is an outright letdown.  Nothing you can craft will ever be seen as anything more than a representative picture occupying a slot in one of your inventories; and the actual number of things you can craft is very limited.From the good, to the mediocre, to the bad, and now the worst: I have spent a long time thinking of a word to describe No Manâs Skyâs user interface. The only single word Iâve come across that comes close to describing how awful, obtuse, and frustrating it is to use is âstillborn.â Thatâs right. Iâm comparing this gameâs UI to a dead infant. The user interface is a collection of horrible design choices.  It starts with camera-snatching.  Every time you meet and alien or achieve an in-game âmilestone,â the camera is removed from your control and a letterbox effect appears for several seconds. These are frequent events where you cannot look around and cannot interact with the world before you. Want to use the market to sell excess resources? Wait several seconds for the buy and sell choices appear (you canât do both in the same menu).  Want to craft something in your inventory? Simple: pick an empty slot, click-and-hold, click-and-hold on the desired product. Want to upgrade your suit, ship, or multitool? Select an empty slot in the appropriate item, donât click-and-hold, hold e instead, click-and-hold on the desired upgrade. Are you noticing a pattern? Everything requires you to press-and-hold. Every. Faffing. Thing. And after a few hours it will infuriate you. I could go on forever like this about the UI, but Iâll stop now and say this: It feels like the developers did everything in their power to make it inefficient and difficult to use.Last I will point out that many features in this game are conspicuous for their absence. Bear in mind that these are my opinions and were not necessarily âpromisedâ by the developer:[/list]*Drivable rovers*Submersibles*A way to map the surfaces of planets and moons*AI spacecraft carrying out tasks beyond taking off and landing at outposts and stations or flying randomly in formation*Aliens moving on foot*Alien cities and villages apart from prefabricated outposts*Statistics tracking*Large non-static spacecraft[/list]I will keep playing this game for a dozen hours or so, if only because it is a beautiful game and some of the flying is a thrill, but unless things change soon, I donât see a future for No Manâs Sky.  The whole game feels very incomplete and I am sorry that I bought it on the notion of how cool it sounded to wander around in a spaceship before I read any reviews. If you want a beautiful game about crafting, exploring, and surviving in hostile environments, go to Steam Early Access and buy Subnautica.  In its current alpha state, it is a far more complete explore & craft experience at half the price."

The creaters made the game zoom out, and that's it. That is the end.

It's got less unique blocks than Terreria, and quite frankly, every planet looked the same."

I know I'm trying to get to the center of the universe and that I should explore, but I don't really know why...  This game is really been about inventory management for me. The only reason I explore and harvest resources is to get better gear so that I can carry more resources to get even better gear to carry even more resources.... It's all very repetitive, even the buildings look the same. If you're into aimlessly wandering around a huge universe, just to see what' kind of stuff you will find, then this is the game for you. There is also some over space combat, which is somewhat fulfilling. So, that could give you some purpose, you could see how awesome of a ship you can build for combat. I'll maybe give it a few more days but I can't see myself playing this long term."

After 70 hours or so of trying to find something that truly surprised me, im sad to say that I gave up very frustrated, and will never play it again.  It's visually very unique, some of the core gameplay loops at first are entertaining but the entire game feels hollow.  Each planet is the same, effectively with slight cosmetic changes on some flora and fauna.  Every planet has every single thing you'd ever encounter in any other planet.  Once you've visited more than 4-5 planets you realize that the  zillions of galaxies  apparently advertised are copy-pasta meant to fill a quota instead of fill a player's mind with amazement."

I still think it's quite an achievement, what Hello Games have managed to create. Especially given the size of their studio. But it wasn't quite good enough, which is a shame. I wanted to like this game.When I think of the number of planets in this game (or try to.. it's a freaking big number), and yet there are elements to this game that seem so shallow. The variation of the planets is quite amazing but, the buildings, for one thing, get incredibly boring when you see the same designs on every planet. There are several designs of building and are always found in one of a handful of combinations. There are always the same things to interact with inside those buildings. Ship designs are sometimes quite cool but their function is always the same barring upgrades. Of course that's the whole point of upgrades but I was expecting actual classes of ships. I think that would have added much more depth.I get that this is a survival and exploration game, so it is expected that you would have to repeat certain activities to ensure your survival. But I just wasn't expecting it to get boring so fast. This is just my view. I am happy that some people are enjoying it and I am sad that others (myself included) are not. I would rate the game 3/5 and sadly, I personally would not (currently) recommend this game.Perhaps in time with updates, this game will improve. And I will gladly change my review if my opinion of the game changes. I will keep checking back to see what updates they have done and fingers crossed, things get better."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 17, 2017              I made a bit of a rant review with a thumbs down after the big NEXT update, because I lost all the work I had put in to the game. I was however finally after 8 hours of frustration (searching for a tiny unmarked base station) able to restore my old save game. If I would not have been able to play from my old save then I probably would have uninstalled the game to never play it again. It sounds like I am over reacting, but the most tedius boring grind of the game is in the first 50 hours of the game. Everything is locked away in the game and they made an excessive grind for you to complete through quests and general gameplay, before you really can start having fun in the game. I simply did not and still don't want to repeat that ever again!So now with my old stuff intact I am trying the update out for a few days and I am having fun again. I like most new stuff in the update even though it was a lot of changes to take in. In the beginning I was not a fan of the new resources refining, but it actually makes sense and it has it's benefits.Multiplayer feature is I hope experimental, because at this point it feels very bare bones and unfinished. You don't actually meet other players in this huge universe, but they connect to you from the starting screen. It is not an MMO setup like EVE where you always have players around you on an external server, the other player is local on your connection only. And at this point I don't think you want to run in randoms anyway due to the griefing reports that are already coming in. So I have the online mode off for now till I am at a point where I can deal with those little griefers with OP weapons and stuff.Graphics and AI have been improved alot and also the terrain is not glitchy anymore. I used to have some occasional terrain texture glitches, but it is all smooth now. The terrain also looks a bit more diverse generated, but that might be a placebo effect :)So yeah, I am giving the game a thumb up again. You do need to expect an excessive grind in the early game stage though and bite through that before the game starts to get fun and you have more freedom in the game. And do keep a back up of your save after the innitial grind, because stuff happens when they do a big update."

Nope, it doesn't exist and they should be sued for blatant false advertising.  I waited this long to write something in hopes that the devs would at least add the things that were missing.  Nope, they haven't done anything.  On top of all of that the game runs like poop.  Better have a beast rig to even play it in the first place. DO NOT BUY!!!"

The graphics are really good but the game is just empty. You travel from one place to the other do the same repetitive tasks over and over again to improve your ship and be able to travel again. At the beginning I loved the really beautiful graphics and being able to be the first player to discover things on planets but then after a while I realized that this was it. I wanted some action so I tried the space fights, but they were no really entertaining either, that's when I realized that this game would go on and on for dozens of hours without bringing anything new, so I gave up before the end."

This game is a shell of what is shown in the trailer. Absolutely no content. Just an interactive wallpaper. On top of that, my game has bugged to a point where I spawn falling from the sky with my ship floating above. There is no way to access the ship. I can't jump high enough. I've requested a refund to Steam but they've rejected it. I haven't played this game in over a month and have no plan on doing so. I believe I was robbed of $60 due to deceiftful marketing by Steam and Hello Games. The game is unplayable and even if it was playable, it isn't worth playing. I hope the class action lawsuit against Hello Games is succesful and we are all awarded the money we had stolen from us. Shame on you Steam. I used to defend you but you're a part of the problem. I seriously give this game a 1/10. Shame on you Sean Murray, you scumbag lying worthless piece of ****."

Like i've said this game is good, but if you belive what the face of hello games says you will be disapointed. He promised stuff for this game that isn't in this game. If he says that it is overpromised then i will change my reveiw.But for now, This is my reveiw and i hope that this game improves. I really hopes that dlc comes out or that Shawn talks i will be happy. I just wish that i hadn't kept playing this game hoping for more.If i could i would refund this game, i would rebuy this if it was good. I just hope that if they don't do anything steam lets up and let people refund this game."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 30, 2016              No Man's Sky.You've heard about it. No matter what, as long as you know anything about the gaming community, then you will know the monumental controversy that was No Man's Sky at release.I myself was hyped for this game. Who wasn't? it had everything we could ask for from a space sim. Planets, a almost-limitless universe to explore, alien life to meet, document, trade with and, if required, be used for target practice, our own ship, massive galactic battles, multiplayer experiences and the feeling that when doing all this, that you were merely experiencing the tiniest of itty-bitty-fractions of what could be experienced in this game.Unfortunately, this game belongs in the dictionary as an example of how to use the word  Lie  in a sentence: Did you hear about No Man's Sky? The devs fed us a lie! Sean Murrey and his team at Hello Games promised the world and gave us a smidgeon of dirt instead.That list of features I said they promised? Lies. The universe can technically be called infinite, as you'd probably die from old age before you explore all of it so kudos to Hello Games for pulling that off.Alien life consists of THREE alien races and whatever random mishmash of appendages and random bits and bobs that are passed off for alien lifeforms. Do they react to the environment? No. Do the alien races do anything other than sit in a  trading post/outpost/space station and talk to you in a language that nobody can be bothered to have to trek around the galaxy to learn just so that they can give you a useless item to go in your already microscopic inventory? No. Do they do ANYTHING OF INTEREST? No.Planets come in a few types. Green, poison, cold, hot, water, dead. When you get down to it, that's it. Just textures that have had the colour palettes swapped over and have been pulled over planets. They look smudged and ugly, even on high settings.In space, nobody can hear you be bored as you hold down whatever key you have your  Super-fast-not-quite-warp-speed-boost  bound to as you wait for minutes on end to reach the next planet. Run out of boost fuel? Mine the asteroids that pop in 5 centimetres from your face. Run out of mining fuel? Land on a planet and mine for mining fuel with your HAND TOOL! Run out of power for that? Mine. Run out of- MINE. EVERY PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY MINING. WHERE'S THE CHALLENGE? ALL THE ELEMENTS YOU NEED ARE SO ABUNDANT ON EVERY PLANET YOU COME ACROSS THAT THERE'S NO ACTUAL THREAT TO YOUR LIFE. What about my ship? If I'm not good at flying, I could crash!  DON'T PANIC! Your ship can't physically collide with ANYTHING. It goes on auto-pilot to prevent you from careening into the side of a mountain or to try and smash a hole in the side of a space station. The game doesn't let you even have the enjoyment of ending it all in a blaze of glory. Landing is automatic by the way. One button and poof. Landed. Your ship's wings may be phasing into a hill but... Eh. Who cares? It's landed.Multiplayer doesn't exist. Period. Sean Murrey danced around the issue and dodged questions like a devout vegan dodges      big macs. The only thing that even shows that there is some slight online play, or at least the facade that there is one (not putting it past them to have lied and created a fake screen to make you think that there's somebody out there in that universe being as bored as you) is a screen showing the list of planets/creatures/galaxies you've named and discovered and it tells you  Other explorers will see your discoveries.  Yeah right. If anyone is still playing. If they can even see me.Oh. And if you're still not convinced: This game costs Â£40 on Steam and promises all these features......Yet it all fits on less than 2.5 GBs. Let that sink in."

I was however finally after 8 hours of frustration (searching for a tiny unmarked base station) able to restore my old save game. If I would not have been able to play from my old save then I probably would have uninstalled the game to never play it again. It sounds like I am over reacting, but the most tedius boring grind of the game is in the first 50 hours of the game. Everything is locked away in the game and they made an excessive grind for you to complete through quests and general gameplay, before you really can start having fun in the game. I simply did not and still don't want to repeat that ever again!So now with my old stuff intact I am trying the update out for a few days and I am having fun again. I like most new stuff in the update even though it was a lot of changes to take in. In the beginning I was not a fan of the new resources refining, but it actually makes sense and it has it's benefits.Multiplayer feature is I hope experimental, because at this point it feels very bare bones and unfinished. You don't actually meet other players in this huge universe, but they connect to you from the starting screen. It is not an MMO setup like EVE where you always have players around you on an external server, the other player is local on your connection only. And at this point I don't think you want to run in randoms anyway due to the griefing reports that are already coming in. So I have the online mode off for now till I am at a point where I can deal with those little griefers with OP weapons and stuff.Graphics and AI have been improved alot and also the terrain is not glitchy anymore. I used to have some occasional terrain texture glitches, but it is all smooth now. The terrain also looks a bit more diverse generated, but that might be a placebo effect :)So yeah, I am giving the game a thumb up again. You do need to expect an excessive grind in the early game stage though and bite through that before the game starts to get fun and you have more freedom in the game. And do keep a back up of your save after the innitial grind, because stuff happens when they do a big update."

I know I'm trying to get to the center of the universe and that I should explore, but I don't really know why...  This game is really been about inventory management for me. The only reason I explore and harvest resources is to get better gear so that I can carry more resources to get even better gear to carry even more resources.... It's all very repetitive, even the buildings look the same. If you're into aimlessly wandering around a huge universe, just to see what' kind of stuff you will find, then this is the game for you. There is also some over space combat, which is somewhat fulfilling. So, that could give you some purpose, you could see how awesome of a ship you can build for combat. I'll maybe give it a few more days but I can't see myself playing this long term."

After 70 hours or so of trying to find something that truly surprised me, im sad to say that I gave up very frustrated, and will never play it again.  It's visually very unique, some of the core gameplay loops at first are entertaining but the entire game feels hollow.  Each planet is the same, effectively with slight cosmetic changes on some flora and fauna.  Every planet has every single thing you'd ever encounter in any other planet.  Once you've visited more than 4-5 planets you realize that the  zillions of galaxies  apparently advertised are copy-pasta meant to fill a quota instead of fill a player's mind with amazement."

Enemy ships can't fly anywhere near a planets atmosphere, and if you fight too far away from a planet, then sentinel ships will instantly spawn to replace ones you defeat... leaving you with no way to warp out, forcing you to manually fly to the nearest planet or just give up and die.Naming anything beyond planets gets erased when you warp out.The planets aren't too bad and look pretty, though it feels like there are only half a dozen different types and maybe 3-4 colour schemes for each.I was kinda bummed that most of their tagline just doesn't happen.EXPLORE, FIGHT, TRADE, SURVIVE.Corrected:EXPLORE waypoints, crappy FIGHTING, no TRADING, very basic SURVIVAL."

Unluckily I was looking forward that this game can be better so I kept playing for a while. Now I can't even get a refund on this because Steam has its refund policy. As some of the comments said if there is a special message about refunding just on top of buying this game, there is something really not good going on. Be aware, don't get scammed like us."

The graphics are really good but the game is just empty. You travel from one place to the other do the same repetitive tasks over and over again to improve your ship and be able to travel again. At the beginning I loved the really beautiful graphics and being able to be the first player to discover things on planets but then after a while I realized that this was it. I wanted some action so I tried the space fights, but they were no really entertaining either, that's when I realized that this game would go on and on for dozens of hours without bringing anything new, so I gave up before the end."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 30, 2016              No Man's Sky.You've heard about it. No matter what, as long as you know anything about the gaming community, then you will know the monumental controversy that was No Man's Sky at release.I myself was hyped for this game. Who wasn't? it had everything we could ask for from a space sim. Planets, a almost-limitless universe to explore, alien life to meet, document, trade with and, if required, be used for target practice, our own ship, massive galactic battles, multiplayer experiences and the feeling that when doing all this, that you were merely experiencing the tiniest of itty-bitty-fractions of what could be experienced in this game.Unfortunately, this game belongs in the dictionary as an example of how to use the word  Lie  in a sentence: Did you hear about No Man's Sky? The devs fed us a lie! Sean Murrey and his team at Hello Games promised the world and gave us a smidgeon of dirt instead.That list of features I said they promised? Lies. The universe can technically be called infinite, as you'd probably die from old age before you explore all of it so kudos to Hello Games for pulling that off.Alien life consists of THREE alien races and whatever random mishmash of appendages and random bits and bobs that are passed off for alien lifeforms. Do they react to the environment? No. Do the alien races do anything other than sit in a  trading post/outpost/space station and talk to you in a language that nobody can be bothered to have to trek around the galaxy to learn just so that they can give you a useless item to go in your already microscopic inventory? No. Do they do ANYTHING OF INTEREST? No.Planets come in a few types. Green, poison, cold, hot, water, dead. When you get down to it, that's it. Just textures that have had the colour palettes swapped over and have been pulled over planets. They look smudged and ugly, even on high settings.In space, nobody can hear you be bored as you hold down whatever key you have your  Super-fast-not-quite-warp-speed-boost  bound to as you wait for minutes on end to reach the next planet. Run out of boost fuel? Mine the asteroids that pop in 5 centimetres from your face. Run out of mining fuel? Land on a planet and mine for mining fuel with your HAND TOOL! Run out of power for that? Mine. Run out of- MINE. EVERY PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY MINING. WHERE'S THE CHALLENGE? ALL THE ELEMENTS YOU NEED ARE SO ABUNDANT ON EVERY PLANET YOU COME ACROSS THAT THERE'S NO ACTUAL THREAT TO YOUR LIFE. What about my ship? If I'm not good at flying, I could crash!  DON'T PANIC! Your ship can't physically collide with ANYTHING. It goes on auto-pilot to prevent you from careening into the side of a mountain or to try and smash a hole in the side of a space station. The game doesn't let you even have the enjoyment of ending it all in a blaze of glory. Landing is automatic by the way. One button and poof. Landed. Your ship's wings may be phasing into a hill but... Eh. Who cares? It's landed.Multiplayer doesn't exist. Period. Sean Murrey danced around the issue and dodged questions like a devout vegan dodges      big macs. The only thing that even shows that there is some slight online play, or at least the facade that there is one (not putting it past them to have lied and created a fake screen to make you think that there's somebody out there in that universe being as bored as you) is a screen showing the list of planets/creatures/galaxies you've named and discovered and it tells you  Other explorers will see your discoveries.  Yeah right. If anyone is still playing. If they can even see me.Oh. And if you're still not convinced: This game costs Â£40 on Steam and promises all these features......Yet it all fits on less than 2.5 GBs. Let that sink in."

It was NOT worth $60. Maybe like $20 or $25. Even with lots of bugs and the possibility that it was falsly advertised, it makes it seem a bit questionable. I did enjoy it for a while, but then I noticed things getting very repetitive. Scan, discover, upload, repeat. Scan, discover, upload, repeat. Repeat. Repeat... And with a lot of the  randomly created creatures  appearing multiple times on different planets, it gets annoying. And gathering resources for your ship: land, gather, refuel, take-off, warp, repeat. Land, gather, refuel, take-off, warp, repeat. Repeat. Repeat... And with no story or anything other than a destination to get to, it just gets boring and uninteresting really fast. After nearly 60 hours in this game trying to give it a chance, I just lost interest and uninstalled it.If you want a space exploration game, this is not it.There's no mutiplayer. You can only craft parts, weapon, suit, multitool and ship upgrades. There is no building ability. Perhaps if building structures were a thing it would be a little more interactive. But then it would just seem like a glorified version of Minecraft."

Space combat and flight was sub par at best, and discovering new species was a glorified game of Pokemon Snap.  If you are interested in the game, you could get a good 10 hours of fun out of it at most, but beyond that...doing the same repetitive grinding for a bigger ship.  Stay away from this one."

Â£80 I could have spent on a game we could have enjoyed together...  That really hits you where you live, you know?  Puts me off buying games from Steam, might just go back to the Xbox.The game is no good.  Do not buy it.  It is boring and repetitive with little to redeem it.  If it had been released as a beta with the promise of more content to come, and if it had been Â£15 and not Â£40, then maybe it would have been worth it.  In case you do not know yet, the advert playing above bears little resemblance to the actual game.  The real ingenuity of this game is seen in the masterful way our expectations were manipulated by the developer."

Through my entire time playing, I didnt see or experience many of the things I had wanted to. Things that are advertised on the steam store page.

Not even a dev update in the last month to say  Hey were still here fixing bugs and getting new content ready for you! I have played a total of 16hrs in order to give the game a chance to actually shine. And well. It hasnt. Its lied, steam has lied, and well apparently I am not eligible a refund EVEN THOUGH this game is a GIANT BAG of False Advertising!**Do Not buy this game, it is false, and the development team are utterly useless!**Utterly attrocious. And yet steam doesnt understand that by the looks of it, it was just a ploy for the developer to make money and then dissapear into the void with it all... Steam refund everyone please and pull this game off the store! Im sure everyone will use the money to buy another game anyway!"

Worst developer dishonesty I've ever seen in a AAA release.If it would have been $29.99, I may have given it a thumbs-up. Probably not though. I've put a lot of time into this game, but most of this was while listening to podcasts. Very little focus and attention is ever required from the player. Wait until a 75% sale before risking your money."

The game is pretty cool for a few hours, and I kept playing, because I've been looking forward to this game for a long time. It didn't totally disappoint, but I've been to a bunch of solar systems and all the planets are pretty much the same. Actually all but a couple of planets have had toxic atmospheres, which overall is just a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥for no gain. I finally found a planet with high sentinels and gravitino balls, which are a cash grab big time, but so what? I fight tons of sentinels for some balls, I manage to buy some better ships. I spend considerable time trying to learn some alien language, collecting stones, but so what? With only a few dialog options I apparently â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tted my way through it, by selecting a random response. There was a few times where I could actually figure my response based on the words I knew. So, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, what?I thought the flora and fauna was randomly generated, but I've seen the same bigâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥land-clam plant thing on every planet. Every single planet, regardless of atmosphere.I haven't been able to launch the game again. I want to enjoy it! I just can't. I can see more diversity in my backyard, which is anchored in reality.I did rename some species with  dong  in the name, like the  Tiny Donghorn  so I got some laughs. It isn't worth sixty bucks I don't think, but it isn't worth zero either. â¥â¥â¥â¥, I don't know.Overall? I would not recommend this game. Check out Planet Explorers (been going a while, but they are working hard, and there is a lot of progress, still going!) build your own vehicles, build colonies/bases, armor, weapons. Elite Dangerous (which is a bigâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥show scam, but the first person cockpit view is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing). Star Trek Online, which has dated graphics but excellent 3rd person ship battles. Watch some videos before you buy!"

Infinite exploration becomes infinite boredom as soon as you realize that they have almost no variation in their algorithms. The same plants, rocks, wildlife, bases and space stations appear every other planet with hardly any variety. Unfortunately, by the time you realize this you are too late to refund. tl;dr: Massive cashgrab because no replay value due to limited nature of algorithm."

Well let me say that i really thought it would get better, it really didnt. You do the exact same thing on each planet, over and over and over again. There was meant to be multiplayer however that was soon discovered it either work or didnt exist. There was alot of potential for this game however once again advertising has lied again. It could become a good game still if they fix the issues and give the game that people wanted when it was showed a long time ago.i think the best thing to do is issue a refund to all who wants it and fix the issues and then it may be worth buying, once that is all done"

        "Comments": "Posted: November 4, 2016              I've been looking for a game similar to Noctis IV for almost fifteen years. I thought NMS would scratch that itch, but unfortunately it doesn't. Which is too bad since initially the game looked promising and I've encountered no bugs or glitches that make the game unplayable. But the developers have made a bunch of design decisions that stack up and seem to be there only to annoy and frustrate the player. Just one of these issues would've been something I could ignore, but the combination makes this game a needlessly hard grind. I'm going to ignore just about everything promised in the pre-release trailers, interviews and fan assumptions and will look at what is actually there. In no particular order my main gripes:Endless pop-up on planets. I understand that these planers are generated on the fly, but the enormous amount of pop-up and low poly models being replaced by high poly models when you get close is immersion breaking.No interesting locations. The first times I discovered one of the bigger temples or monoliths I was impressed. The big problem is that there is nothing to do, you can only observe and there is little to do or see. After a little while you realise that they all look alike. Right now I'm (re)playing Skyrim and I just love the way every temple, cave, ruin has booby traps, enemies, lore and often a side quest associated. Apart from same vague poetic messages NMS fails to deliver anything similarly engaging.Too many alien structures. While it's nice to be able to barter for stuff, the lack of real settlements and the presence of hundreds of small alien structures on each and every planet makes no sense. I would have enjoyed finding the odd ruined temple here and desolate city there. Instead there just tons of small alien structures everywhere. I would have preferred only a few meaningful ruins filled with traps, enemies, loot and stories.Lack of maps. Yes, you can look at the map of the galaxy, but it's useless because it lacks any structure. All you see is an enormous mass of dots, each of which is a solar system. But there is no way to tell how far you are from the centre and also no way of telling where you have been. You'll have to click each star in sight and hope you've named the solar system in a meaningful way, otherwise it's nearly impossible to tell stars you've visited. There is also no map of each solar system, making it hard to select a specific planet or moon. You just have to point your ship based on the radar which is rather useless when there more than four objects in a solar system. And finally there is no map of the planet you are visiting. This makes it almost impossible to go back to a landmark you visited before. This also means there is no way to plan your trip across the planet. In the long run this lack of planning where you're going and seeing where you have been diminished my enjoyment of the game. It all feels very random what you're doing, you're basically flying blind.You can't scan solar systems and planets. Wall, not in any meaningful way. The only way to find out which resources you'll find in the asteroids in a solar system and which resources can be found on which planet was to actually shoot a bunch of asteroids and see which minerals you're collecting. I really don't understand why I can't scan these asteroids and get an indicator over each asteroid showing me what they consist of. Scientist can do this nowadays using primitive instruments, and somehow in the NMS universe sensors are not able to scan asteroids directly in front of the ship. What I would have expected was to be able to look at the galaxy map and get a break down of the minerals and percentages I would likely find in a solar system. And once I'm there to be able to see in a solar map which minerals can be mined from asteroids and which planets contain which minerals (at least the most dominant ones). It's not a big deal in the beginning of the game where most upgrades require small amounts of common materials. But once you get to the higher tier upgrades the search for specific crafting materials becomes a hopeless grind. If you're lucky you'll find what you need in just a couple of hours(!). But I've spent over twenty hours without coming across a bunch of specific crafting materials I needed. I want to be able to plan ahead and either go back to a planet that I know has the materials I need or a way to go to a solar system that likely has what I need. Right now the first is extremely hard and the second is impossible.Inventory management. Using the same grid for storing items and upgrades makes no sense whatsoever. The way that small items fail to stack like mining materials is extremely annoying and seems to only be there to slow player progression down. The fact that you can't simply move any upgrades but instead have to break them down and then build them again also makes no sense whatsoever. I should be able to just pick up and reorder my upgrades. And there should be separate inventories for ship and suit upgrades and ship and suit supplies.Micro management. I've been to planets that are extremely hot in the day time, extremely cold at night and feature both radiation and acidic rain. I have shields to protect me against each of these dangers. But each of my shield upgrades will run down separately. So I have to click each one of them and indicate which material I want to use to recharge them. This can take up way too much time. This should be automated. Period.Ship and multi tool upgrades. Unlike your suit, you can't buy or find extra slots for your ship or multitool. Instead you're meant to replace them with higher tier versions. Don't like the design? Tough luck, you'll just have to wait for a different version to come along. Ships with as little as two slots more than your current ship can cost several million credits. Even using various ways of generating quick cash, it takes several hours to save up for a ship that is only marginally better than your current one. And then you'll have to spent hours upon hours rebuilding all equipment. What I would've liked to have seen was being able to design the ship myself by copying parts I like from ships I've encountered. Same with the multi tool.No customisation of your space suit. I know there is no multiplayer and it's strictly a first person game. But I still would like to be able to change the appearance of my space suit to match my mood.Combat or rather the lack of any. I know, you have to fight space pirates and the mysterious peace keeping force. But none of the combat feels satisfying. In Fallout you really had to be careful around some creatures since they are much stronger than the player. But in NMS you can easily kill any creature. I never needed the alternative fire mode, the mining laser is so much overpowered, This completely takes away any challenge.  I would have liked to have faced stronger, smarter enemies. And it would also have been nice if some of the creatures would be more vulnerable for specific types of damage, forcing the player to shift between weapons and modes.Not enough variety between planets. Like pretty much any player will remark: there is not enough variety between the different planet types. Now I understand that tweaking the parameters too much will create items with arms and legs that will clip through stuff all the time. But I've yet to find a planet with really big plants, trees or animals. The lack of really tall trees or dense forests makes planets look alike after a while.Dumb creature AI. The trailer showed us creates eating leaves from trees, predators hunting prey etc. But in reality this interaction is very limited and underwhelming.The complete randomness of everything you encounter in combination with the lack of any means to plan ahead and lots of tedious micro management make NMS a very annoying game to play. A complete overhaul is needed."

Only algorithmic generated content seems not (yet) to provide the necessary game depth. Probably itâs the later which I really miss!For this price of around 75$ I payed here in Switzerland I would have expected much more!"

Combat is minecraft level simplistic, resource gathering is largely pointless, and you can't build anything other than add-on modules for your gear/ship.I've got a pretty good feeling that this game will be abandonware within the next 6 months to a year. No one will ever hear from the devs again, Sony will stop all support on the PS4, and unlucky suckers like me will be out $60 because we didn't read the reviews before hitting the purchase button.It's like a slightly more stable, less feature rich StarForge at the moment, and I don't think it's going to get any better. Not now, not ever.DO NOT BUY THIS  GAME  UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES"

Not a wholly bad game although I would have wished to wait maybe another 6 months before picking it up, because the game feels like an expensive early-alpha. I'm sure that Hello Games will dedicate their time improving this game (when they're not pole-vaulting into their pyramid of cash) and with time, this game has the possibility of becoming great. It's just that now, it's not worth picking up."

Then, a gaming buddy picked it up and really liked it. Eventually, I got it on the off chance I'd like it as well.Had it not much more than a month and already have 80 hours invested. I absolutely love it. I get where it may not be for everyone (i.e., no quick path to godhood). You pay for everything in this game. Upgrades cost units, and that means putting in the time whether you buy your dream ship outright, or fly endless circuits of a planet in the hopes of finding the just right ride and restore it to functionality. This is NOT the game for people looking for instant gratification.Pros:Literally endless worlds to exploreArtwork is beautifulGood building mechanicsConsThe questlines can get a little confusing."

I refused to buy it with all the disappointment surrounding it's initial release.  The NEXT update has changed all of that.  I decided to give it a chance, and if it didn't excite me in 2 hours, I would request a refund.  Well I started it up, started doin my thing and hours later I was hooked.  Sure it has a slight learning curve, and if you made a mistake like I did you gotta backtrack a bit.  But I want more, I mean I want to play more, it's very enjoyable.  It's still rough around the edges, but barely noticable.  I have enjoyed the base building, the search to build things from blueprints is rewarding.  The colour pallete is much improved, planets are a joy to explore, and so much fun to find stuff.  It's by no means perfect, but it is a game well worth the current 50% off, and dare I say full price now.  It's most of what we wanted, and the Hello Games crew have done a hell of job reviving and retooling this game.  Now, I gotta get going to fix the broken Multi-Tool I traded for my perfectly working Multi-tool.  That trader tricked me......"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 19, 2018              This game started off as the most hyped up game ever made. However, the launch of the game was filled with bugs and  A very disappointing ending  that people did not enjoy. Hello Games could have let No Man's Sky fall into a dark pit of nothing and go onto a different project. On November 27th, 2016 Hello Games released a trailer for the Foundation Update. This update added base building, game modes, and freighters and paved the way to whole new opportunities. Early in 2017 Hello Games released the Path Finder Update which included graphic updates, workshop compatibility, and exocrafts to make exploring even more fun. Then with their latest update, Atlas Rises added 30+ hours of story, a new alien race, low flight, better ship combat, and the first steps of multiplayer. Now comes July of 2018, almost 2 years after the game launched. No Man's Sky Next comes with Multiplayer with 2-4 friends or random players, character customization, colonies, 3rd person perspective, better underwater atmosphere, ringed planets, capital ships, enhanced weather, and so much more. No Man's Sky Next drops on July 24th for free to all players and will included so much more to be revealed. Hello Games has tried their hardest to bring back a once failed game and make it better than ever imagined. This game is worth a try and some of your time and as said by the developers will continue to grow and get better as time goes on."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 14, 2016              This is a fantastic concept and I applaud Hello Games for taking a risk here.The game in its current state feels like it should be a beta. The numerous glitches and performance issues can be fixed easily so I won't complain too much about them.To put it out there, the game is far too overpriced for an indie title.In terms of gameplay the planets are far too populated and points of interest are too common,  it feels nothing like you are an Explorer as was advertised, all the planets already have outposts with teh main factions in them. Intelligent life and life in general is everywhere, this really shatters the immersion. Coming across life should be a special occasion, not run of the mill. Of all the planets I have visited all but one had animals and all had plants with numerous point of interest dotted every 500m. This has got to be by far my biggest disappointment about this game. I followed it from the start and this seems like they sold out to the hype for mroe to do. Flying and landing are very painful, I am not sure what they were thinking with this. WTF. It si bearable but flying is not fun (Dare I mention spore).In stations there are no NPCs walking arounf or anything, everything is static there. Not too annoyed about that, it is just noted. On the plus side, I thought the terrain generation and HUGE planets with rolling weather patterns to be absolutely fantastic. Top job there with great variation. With the animals though, the same model with random bits stuck to it gets rather old but I am not too fussed about that, there is still a lot of variaion with some entertaining combinations. Crafting is another strong point IMO, though it would be nice to have a similar feature with the multi-tool as the ship. Where you could swap the parts before trading, some of those mods are expensive. As much fun as I have had with it, I cannot reccomend it for this release price. The fans cannot help but feel lied to with a lot of the stuff.Edit after a while:  The fans were straight conned and ripped off. They knew they would never be able to live up to SMs promises and so chucked up the price ready to run. I hope they never make another game. I have learnt my lesson about waiting for reviews, and I hope others have too. 50% of those hours were idle afk time."

There's plenty of entertainment hours to be had here if you enjoy it.Then again with the NEXT update they've added even more to the game. We can now build our bases anywhere we want, we can entire fleets of ships and send them in missions across the galaxy. We can party up with friends and explore the universe together.Since the Next update the developers kept pushing out update after update, all free and with great new content and events.I really can't say what exactly I like about the game, but there has to be something since I've played it like a madman for 2 weeks after I bought it."

Even if the game didnât constantly crash, even if the FPS were good, even if the game did not require constant grinding to simply wash-rinse-and-repeat with no true progression, I would not recommend this game. If it were $20, maybe but not $60.That being said, I will hand it to the creator; the mechanics behind No Manâs Sky are truly impressive and mind boggling but it ends there. ---------------A few more hours in: Crashing is fixed for me now and the FPS are stable with no more dips from 40-50FPS to 10FPS. The game pulled me back again and I have given it another try. Yet after each session I set down the controller and feel empty. I enjoy survival/exploration games. I do not mind monotonous tasks, in fact I quite enjoy the pace; it allows me the time think and a medium for rebuilding resiliency. I am always compelled to see what on the other side of the next hill, not because there something to be gained, rather just to do it.However, No Manâs Sky still leaves me with very little sense of accomplishment. When I take a moment and look around me in our virtual universe I realize that where I am now is similar to where I have been and not too different from where I am going. Every day feels like Groundhog Day/Same-Same but differentãããããã. This in its self is something that I would expect from a game of this size and complexity (or lack of complexity) but where my issue lies is that there is very little tying me to NMS. I do not really impact the universe and the universe honestly doesnât impact me (maybe thatâs the point?). We do NMS no justice by stratifying it against other games. With that being said, in other games that I enjoy there is this dynamic relation between me and virtual world which can manifest itself in many fashions. Even if Iâm grinding for resources just to simply build something. At the end of the day I can look around and see my efforts regardless if Iâm going to do the same thing tomorrow. In other instances, I may make not impact the virtual world at all, but I usually feel this sense building experiences when I can think back at my time in a game and âremember that one time that I that thing because it was coolâ even if it is insignificant to others. NMS gave me similar experiences for the first couple hours but after warping to dozens of stars I can say that I still feel empty. In my opinion it is not a bad game and has a good foundation for more. But for now its not worth my time and defiantly not worth the $60 I played."

I didn't think that before but I recently found some old gameplays from before the game was released and some of the empty promises made by Sean Murray. I must say that this boring excuse of a video game looks nothing like the NMS we were promised and shown. You might want to watch AngryJoe's review, I thought he did a pretty good job gathering those in one video. Other than that, the game could still have been good even if it didn't come out as expected but it didn't. Horrible visuals and extremely repetitive gameplay. I searched through a sh-t ton of planets for materials to build and recharge my hyperdrive and I finally did. Guess what the next objective was. Build another one. Really? I don't mean just the objectives. Gameplay itself is pretty repetitive as well. Mine, discover, get money, upgrade your ship. That's pretty much it. It just doesn't feel like a complete game. Only buy it if you are very rich and fine with enjoying a 60 $ game for about an hour.Congrats Sean, you just made one of the most boring games of all time."

First of all you wont get any planets like the ones you see in the trailers, those are pre generated so they have something that is not barren to show off... (lies... you can see where im going with this).This game starts to get repetative at about 4-5 hours, once you grasp the concept you can see that its pretty pointless and an all looks no real gameplay type of game.It's basicly a rock collecting simulator to craft upgrades for you and your ship, which the upgrades help you in combat but the whole combat in this game is shooting pirates and/or sentinels which... is pretty shallow and dull.... chasing around and shooting enemy ships while opening inventory to replenish your ships shields rinse repeat....When you reach the center (if you give the game a piece of your lifespan) you get started over to which you start back at square one at the edge of the galaxy wow such a goal!!! if you follow the atlas path and collect all stones you end up getting to create a star and naming it which is like owning a basketball with your name on it dropped out of a plane somewhere in the middle of a random desert, you will never be able to see or interact with it/experience its existence you just know its somewhere out there. so yeah thats basicly it for $60, once i found out there wasnt really much more to the point of the game than that i just stopped playing, there was no sense on burning my time on the most pointless upgrades and progression anymore because theres no next tier or reward or advancment in difficulty, the game stays the same the whole way you basicly just get a new ship and upgrades to make things a slightly easier less challenging grind for you, thats really it."

The bugs have been pretty horrific, but I'm sure they'll get fixed soon enough - no it's more than than. The game itself is not great.Don't get me wrong - NMS has potential in spades, and the procedural generation system for planets is pretty cool. Still, it's clear that a whole HEAP of promised content and features were cut. Not only that, but some of the stuff in-game is disjointed, and seems to have been designed for an earlier build which didn't materialise.A couple of examples - transmissions: When you uncover a new waypoint you're often told that you've discovered a new point in the stars, or a new planet in the great infinity or whatever. But no, that never actually happens. You just found a factory a couple of clicks away. Also relay towers: Early videos suggested they were used to upload new discoveries. Now they're completely pointless, serving no purpose that isn't already done by other things.Once you get over the initial beauty of some of the planets, you quickly realise that the gameplay itself is incredibly thin, and gets stale within an hour or so. If you've played for a few hours, you've likely seen *everything* the game has to offer. Grind resources, to get more inventory space. That's essentially the game in a nutshell.And of course, last but not least, I don't appreciate being deceived. Whilst I'm not going to say that Hello Games deliberately *lied*, they certainly didn't tell the truth in interviews and marketing material. The videos on this very steam page are *completely* unrepresentative of the game as it was released. We all wish we had THAT game.If the fun (and missing features) get patched in at a later date I may update this review. I'm not holding my breath.Edit: It's been pointed out (quite fairly) that I've played a fair few hours for someone who doesn't recommend the game. I'll add this addendum - if the game cost 20 bucks, I'd probably be giving it a thumbs up, if only as an interesting curiosity. Right now I feel compelled to squeeze any enjoyment that I can out of this overly expensive toy.EDIT: Updating for the 'He took our money and ran' award. ;)"

What you get is a game where you have to continuously grind away hour after hour in the hopes of reaching some end goal but with no real incentive to go there other than your own curiosity.  Leading up to this games release, I knew it wasnt going to live up to its hype and so I wasnt seriously dissapointed like other people were.  The biggest let down of all though was the continual promise of multiplayer gameplay and its absolute abscense from the game upon release.  If you do end up buying this game and you don't like it, make sure to ask for your money back and make noise about it.  The only way this will change is if enough of us are heard."

You will find the same small handfull of buildings and NPCs on every planet and they all have the exact same stuff in them. 90% of the creatures look like something you'd make in Spore after downing a couple of 40s. The landscape of the entire planet is identical to whatever small patch you decided to land on. You will find the same elements everywhere. The entire point of this game is to make your inventory bigger so you can make an incredibly shi**y system slightly less shi**y.So much wasted potential here. It wouldn't be so bad if the marketing wasn't a bold faced lie."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 25, 2016              This is a 20$ game at a 60$ price tag. As many have said, most of the game was  left on the chopping block or was just never actually developed. I wasn't going to buy it, but I was curious how much of the game was actually there. I gave it 20 hours of my time to see if what it offered was at least worth looking at. The game can be fun, from random exploring on the ground or jumping into a new system, but most of it is just annoying and filler. From resources that you already mined reappearing as you get too far away, then vanishing as you get close, to signal scanners sending you to places you've already been, to the repetitive nature of the game itself. I liked the idea of exploring a planet for what it had to offer, and then going to the next, but if you play for more than an hour at a time, each planet will just get boring after about 20-30 minutes from the stated above. The 3 factions have no actual interactions so caring about one side or another during all othe coversations is hard to hold onto. Game is a 3 out of 10. I'll keep it in my library because of they add all the the things they advertised, it would be an awesome game. As it stands though, better to just keep an eye on Star Citizen."
