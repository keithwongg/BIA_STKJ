With the growing popularity of online shopping, product reviews are one of the most important things consumers look out for when making purchasing decisions. As products are widely available on various e-commerce platforms, consumers have to go to multiple websites to read product reviews before making a purchasing decision. It is extremely time consuming and this project aims to resolve this inconvenience through a web-based application where product reviews are collated, analyzed and condensed into a single/short description/summary/scoring etcâ€¦ review for a one-stop shop for ease of convenience.

Scope: Game Reviews

Websites (Data-Sources): Steam, YouTube, Reddit

Products: 
- Currently, we are focusing on Dark Souls 3 and No Man's Sky
- More products to be included once the initial model is done
