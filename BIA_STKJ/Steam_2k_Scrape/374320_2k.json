Since I've started playing the Souls series, I have not been able to fully get into any other game. I'll start playing something else, but am always thinking about yet another way to play this game. Building yet another character (why oh why can I only have 10) using a different weapon and style of play. People ask me whether I get bored playing it again and again. For me it is no longer about level design but rather about discovering new ways to play and challenge myself. For me I feel there will never be another game like this."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 27, 2017              Recently I was asked by a friend who is new to the souls series what i thought of this game, so I thought I'd put what i wrote him here.This game is a masterpiece.I'd recommend it, but I will say its hard, like it can be discouraging at times.However, there are few feelings that come close to the sensation of defeating a boss or enemy you've been stuck on for hours.TL:DR= Beautiful game, challenging but rewarding fighting system and a non intrusive but intriguing narrative to boot. 9/10Ill keep the review brief so you can skim through it, because, honestly, you've got to experience the game for yourself to fully comprehend what this game is about.Story= Vague (left to interpretation sorta' thing) but intriguing. You're character seems to be the only one out of the loop and it really helps cement the idea that youre not ready for the grand task you've been given. You'd expect alot of satisfaction from the end of the game, however the real story chunks are tucked away in item descriptions and in the connotations of NPC's.Visuals= F***ing fantastic. Graphics are great even on low settings and this mystical middle age setting looks so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing incredible. The world is detailed and reinforces the main story with hints of the impennding doom that a dark age will induce. Oh, and fashion souls is real, and trust me you're going to spend a lot of time making your character look badass.Gameplay= Toughest part. Easy to learn, hard to master. The levelling system require stat placement which means various builds can be created with various intended functions: from melee builds to caster builds to healing builds. Some styles are more forgiving than others and others require late game items/bonuses/spells to properly flourish. There are, of course, Meta builds that perform pretty well but everyone will also be trying to perfect there own build.Online= Fantastic. Community is still pretty big for PvE and PvP but, the game is getting getting old now. Co-op is great and can be used through most of game (minus something like 3 transitory areas that dont really have anything important in them). Invasions are what made dark souls work: getting invaded and winning a duel makes you feel powerful if its a 1v1. Invading can be unforgiving because of gank squads (2+ players who corner single invaders) but it can be so rewarding when you pull of a whole squad kill and you get to do the infamous 'point down' gesture. PvP has its own arena if invading gets tiresome, so thats a plus. But high wait times if your not around the meta level in arena (Soul level 120 is the recommended meta range). General PvP can be alot more frustrating than other games but alot more rewarding. Mistakes can be unforgiving and there is a big issue with the lag in fights. However, for a guy who I know likes to feel the flurry of a good fight, this s*** delivers. Highly tactical gameplay that rewards smart decisions and good spacing. Dont get me wrong, the arena is useful for easy matchmaking but theres a whole pvp system called fight clubs where players gather in a non dlc area to do 1v1s (fair warning: there are no real rule enforcement in fight clubs so you just gotta' act honorable and hope your fighting compatriots do too and not gank you).Thanks for reading, this has been my first review on steam so I hope its clear and legible :)I look forward to invading you, and may the flames guide thee!"

        "Comments": "Posted: December 15, 2016              Dark Souls is - and always has been - acquired taste. Out of all my friends on Steam, most of whom I know personally and share interests with, I can count those who play Dark Souls 3 on a single hand.When I first heard of Dark Souls, I would have never believed I would spend hundreds of hours on one of the series' games. I was intimidated by the difficulty and attempts to complete the first title resulted in frustration and anger. I felt inadequate, because the setting appealed greatly to me, but I wasn't very proficient at the combat mechanics, which force you to critically analyse your surroundings, memorise attack patterns and generally be cautious. And that's where that ended back then.Then, Bloodborne came out and immediately grabbed my attention and renewed my interest in games of the Soulsborne franchise. It was actually the first of the games I completed.Here's the deal: These games reflect upon your ability to deal with a variety of situations. They reflect whether you are able to handle loss, whether you can keep a cool head in a tight situation. So maybe, you are very impulsive, make decisions on the fly and maybe everything turns out okay every once in a while. But are you able to bear the guilt of your failures, the fact that you have made a mistake? If not, you will rage, you will become frustrated or even doubt yourself. You'll throw controllers and shout at the screen, just as much as you might feel the frustration pulse through you in any situation in life. But can you improve? That is a clear yes. It's definitely possible, but you have to be willing. And overcoming a seemingly unsurmountable obstacle through great effort, training, and self-reflection is a wonderful feeling.Giving you control of a character that seems to be so severely underpowered in a world of giant beasts and magnitudinous god-creatures is intimidating. But along the way you will find that any God may have its weakness and a character that seems weak at first may have unforeseen strengths. The only thing you can rely on is yourself and your willingness to learn and persist, or you may lose your sanity. Everything in this world is supposed to make you feel small, weak and endangered, but you have it in your hand to change the perception you have of yourself.Will you like this game? That depends on you. Are you willing to give yourself a chance?"

I got too greedy trying to get another swing in and it cost me. Patience and memorization are important here. It's like a puzzle almost. You learn the level, what enemies are where, enemies attack patterns, find shortcuts. Then it becomes almost trivial the enemies and bosses you had such a hard time with before. One caveat is that I could never get overconfident. Despite knowing what to do I could still screw up so when I die or take a large amount of damage it's my fault.Always respect your opponent, no matter how confident you think you are, enemies can and will punish your mistakes."

        "Comments": "Posted: February 4, 2018              Let me note a couple things, first off this is my first ever actual review so please don't chew me up.Second, an absurd amount of people are getting this from Humble Bumble this month, which is good dont get me wrong but you should probably know what you're getting yourself into.I also dont have much experience with the other souls game but thats subject to change, in other words this is coming from a strictly Dark Souls 3 player, no bias from the other games or any of that.As for gameplay I believe this game excels once you get ahold of it, I caught on pretty late, didnt know what fat rolling was or why I was so slow up to Yhorm before a friend explained it to me, so yeah, darn. Speakings of Yhorm I didn't like the  Storm Ruler   gimmick at all, same goes with Wolnir's  Braclets  I mean you dont technically have to do the Yhorm thing, but its your best bet, I digress. Other then the little things that made the game that much easier, the gameplay kept me on my toes, and my controller(s) accross my roomSoundtrack wise it really stuck with me as well, especially the Main Menu theme, cause who can forget it?Lets talk about the Story, this is pretty difficult to pick up on for the most part, you have to read vague item descriptions and do the little side quests to really get into it, I'm gonna summarize it for you guys though.You are the Ashen One given the task to hunt down and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones in the Firelink Shrine to Link the flame once more in order to prevent the age of dark.I think I'm gonna bring up replayability lastly, because thats usually pretty important, which its there.Between NG+ and the achievements I've sank a good 40 hours of my time into this game in 2 weeks, according to steam, which may not be super impressive but its been an everyday routine to hop on and progress on my favorite RPG to date.My final verdict? Buy it and dont give up, this game is HARD to put it lightlyGameplay = 9/10OST = 8.5/10Story = 8/10Replay Value = 8.5/10Total Score = 9/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: June 29, 2018           Product received for free              Seriously, one of the best games i've ever played in my life.I've never been a fan of RPGs myself, always went for FPS games. But i got an interest for this game, for it was known for it's  diffculty  (more onto that later), the bosses, the sceneries, etc.I was gifted this game, and i have to say, it was one of the best gifts i've ever received.About the game itself, if you are scared to pick it up, don't. The game is not as hard as people make it out to be, it just leaves you to discover stuff for yourself, to learn the mechanics, playstyles, etc.This game is by far the best for beginners to the DARK SOULS franchise, for it has the most polished gameplay out of the three, with some more simpler mechanics...kinda of. Parries are definetely something that actually requires a bit of skill, and the same goes for backstabs, to a certain extent. You have to be more precise with stab than in previous games, but we're getting offtrack. The story is good, nothing really amazing, but the main focus of the story is good. The lore of the rest of the kingdom of Lothric (and the DLC worlds too) are what's interesting about DARK SOULS games. The lore of every boss, every area, every enemy, it's all really fascinating and well crafted, just like in other games, so it doesn't disappoint in that regard.Gameplay in itself i found pretty satisfying, but i do think the PVP part of the game could have some problems fixed (Hackers, Griefers, etc)Soundtrack in the game is also pretty awesome. There is something in particular about the Final Boss' theme that has made a lot of people really emotional (myself included). It's a really cool easter egg, but i won't spoil anything. This game's music is something you have to experience yourself to understand how awesome and well produced it is.The game in itself is beautiful. It has stunning graphics and is extremely well optimized (except for the beggining of the Ringed City DLC, all the ash may eat up your frames). All the effects, boss fights, sceneries and enemies have an immense amount of care put into them, to make them feel like they belong in this fantasy world, and to look the best they possibly can. In short, DARK SOULS 3 is an amazing game, not too far from a masterpiece in my opinion. Shame that it still has some things that should've been improved by this time, but whatever, the game is still playable. I highly recommend giving this game a try. Seriously, it's amazing."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 13, 2018              Ok I think I have played this game enough to give it a proper review. ====TL:DR====Great game single player wise. Excellent boss fights and music. Fairly high replayability value. Tons of weapons, armor and spells for you to try out. A few glitches in PvE but nothing serious. Feels closer to Dark Souls 1 than 2.Co-op is fun as always. PvP has some issues so it's a hit or miss. There are some bugs in multiplayer caused by lag.As for DLCs, 1st DLC felt short. But it has a great boss fight. 2nd DLC is simply amazing. Well worth the money.I highly recommend this game. This has become one of my all-time favorite games.Lengthy but detailed review ahead.======The bad======Game has slight occasional glitches such as enemies glitching through terrain, enemy projectiles going through solid objects such as walls or even the floor. Keep in mind these are not frequent. Some people may experience micro stuttering issues even on capable hardware.Spell casting is more difficult in this game due to two reasons. You can't reliably cancel casting animations (except healing miracles). This makes using magic against fast bosses/enemies a nightmare. You don't have a fixed amount of spell uses like in previous games. You have a mana bar. (called FP in this game, I just call it mana) and you have to use Ashen Estus flasks to refill your mana bar. This is not a bad thing. The bad thing is you have to allocate some of your healing Estus flasks as Ashen Estus flasks (you can change the amount). A mage already invests a lot into stats and equipment (just like previous Souls games) but now mages must sacrifice some of their healing Estus flasks as well. I call bull on this one.Ability to dual wield pretty much any weapon combination and powerstancing is GONE. One of the best things Dark Souls 2 brought to the table, is just gone. There are some paired weapons in the game but they are few. You can still equip weapons in both hands but the ones in left hand cannot use their full moveset.New Game+ is not nearly as creative as in Dark Souls 2. There are more powerful versions of rings in NG+ and NG++ but that's it.The biggest issue in multiplayer IMO is the bugs that are mainly caused by latency issues. For co-op, it's possible for friendly phantoms to get stuck outside the boss fog gate (can't go in). This is because friendly phantoms are not yet properly synced with host's world. This will be obvious to you as the phantom since host player's animations will be static until you're properly synced. If it's a friend you can ask him to wait. But can't do that with random strangers. I never summon people because of this. However I place my summon sign all the time and it goes without issues most of the time. For PvP, it's possible that you can never hit the invader because he has no hitbox (invader is not really cheating here). Just like friendly phantoms have no hitbox when you try to attack them. But the invader can hit you just fine. This issue only seem to happen when you have friendly phantoms in your world, regardless whether they're NPC or actual people. It's as if the game mistakenly treat the invader as a friendly phantom on your end but on their end, it's normal.PvP was not enjoyable for me. Invasions prioritize hosts with friendly phantoms so if you invade, you'll be fighting multiple people at the same time. The game has much faster combat in PvE than previous Souls games so rolling cost very little stamina and healing with Estus is almost instant. These things make PvP a headache. In invasions everyone can heal, even friendly phantoms and invaders. This is very annoying when you're a lone host (like me) and invader runs behind enemies and use Estus.========The neutral========This game has no standard poise. Some weapon skills and spells grant you poise for a brief moment. You still have hyper-armor. This can be good as you won't run into havel monsters with straight swords. This is not good when a puny hollow with a tiny broken sword can stagger you when you're in full havel armor which literally made of heavy stones.Game is very linear compared to previous Souls games. Personally I don't mind this. But it can get repetitive when you're doing another playthrough.A lot of fan service of Dark Souls 1. I don't usually mind this but sometimes it felt a bit too much.=======The good=======Ok finally we get to the good stuff.Despite all the issues I mentioned, PvE gameplay is still really fun. Weapons have smooth transitions from one attack to the next. You can play smart using both melee and ranged weapons to make things easier. Combat is a lot faster and way more fluid than previous games. This makes some fights really intense. And as usual, the game is quite challenging (except in the beginning)Weapons have weapon skills that use your mana bar. These are special moves or sometimes buffs. Some of those moves are downright crazy, in a good way.Most boss fights are simply AMAZING. Has some of the best boss fights in the series and some of the most difficult. Bosses have good AI and most have a good amount of different attack patterns. And some bosses are quite fast. They'll definitely keep you on your toes. Boss fights also change usually midway into the fight.Most boss soundtracks are incredible. This one has the best music in all the Souls games IMO.Fairly high replayability value. (not as high as Dark Souls 2 though) I had a blast playing the game with different characters (some melee, some magic). Also did SL1 challenge run and a bow only challenge run. They were more fun than I'd anticipated.Co-op is still awesome. No more Soul Memory. You can set a password so only those with same password can connect to each other. This method override usual things that restrict connecting with people, things like being in same Soul Level range. This makes playing with friends easier than ever. Even a very high level character can join a low level character, but high level characters will be nerfed to match the host's level.Overall I highly recommend this game based on how awesome single player content is. Praise the Sun "

        "Comments": "Posted: August 11, 2017              DARK SOULSâ¢ IIIImportant premise: the following review is based on my personal experience.            Pros        Cons                    Soundtracks    Care for the details    Dubbing    Sceneries    Realism    Originality            Online functionalities    Gameplay faults    MatchmakingExplanation Pros:                The soundtracks have been realized with an incommensurable mastery, passion and love. Each one of them is perfectly coherent with the experiences the player is living, and perfectly represents the story and the essence of every boss that is encoutered.    The care for the details is undoubtely impressive. The ashes flying away from the torch with a direction based on the wind, the areas and structures design, the camera view getting blury while passing through a spiderweb, the shadow of the main character getting bigger or smaller based on his distance from the fire, and much more.     The dubbing is, in my honest opinion, spectacular. I believe I have almost never heard in a videogame such realistic, convincing  voices, other than perfectly coherent with every meetable character.    The sceneries are incredibly realistic, full of atmosphere, and some of them even majestic, thanks to the praiseworthy care for details and the excellent sound effects.    Realism is another strenght point this game has. Naturalness of the character's movements, alongside with npcs, common enemies and bosses; in a specifical boss fight, the huge wings flapping of the enemy makes the character tossing back due to the huge air blow; during another boss fight, the enemy roared as sign of victory after defeating me.  What I want to say with these examples is that it looks like reading a fantasy book and living it firsthand.    There is also a lot of originality: you never know what's coming, every boss fight is different from the others, there are some environmental interactions that have to be done in order to proceed, and much more. I can't continue with the examples because they would be dangerous spoilers, but I can surely say that, after sometime, I just kept being surprised over and over again and left for a long time speechless.Cons:               The online functionalities still have evident problems, especially about PvP (Player versus Player). From my personal experience, 70% of the times there was a huge lag that made the game session basically unplayable, despite my internet connection is more than suitable for it. The introduction of limited area matchmaking function helped just very marginally, having almost an unnoticed impact. Luckily, the PvP arena seems to be immune from this problem. Also, the online is not free from hackers (altough it's very rare: I just met one in 127 hours of gameplay. He didn't take any damage despite the constant blows that hit him).    There are some gameplay faults. For example, some enemies can still hit you through a wall, there are very rare problems with environment interactions (sometimes when I walk up and there are stairs, my character got blocked and I had to change direction to  unlock  him); artificial intelligence very rarely not working properly (attacking randomly if provoked from distance; attacking the character and then randomly returning to its position). I have also experienced some rare, random and huge FPS drops, despite my machine can easily run this game with every setting on maximum without any problem. I solved it by  reloading the area . Very rarely, some enemies got stuck inside the surfaces. Finally, when I tried to deposit some items in the storage, they returned back to my inventory.     The matchmaking is indeed criticizable, because it completely ignores the skill difference of the players. This usually causes an almost immediate victory / loss without the  loser  even having the chance to react. For example, out of the 70+ PvP matches I did, I won only one. Final considerations: I personally do not recommend playing this game with a guide, because it might ruin the surprise element, one of the most important features this product has. Even if you are in great difficulty, you can always ask for help to the community. There are a lot of good players who will be glad and willing to help, assisting you through jolly cooperations. If you  feel like you need a pause, or simply do not want to go foward, you can always help the others by being summoned as a ghost in any area you have already visited: in this way you will be able to explore better the places you have already been at, and where you will have to go, while helping another player. The main plot, linked to the two previous games, concludes here, giving generally any explanation to the unanswered questions, through dialogues, descriptions and surroundings. It's a game rich of contents, probably the richest (it took me more than 120 hours to complete it, while the previous ones required me 82 and 90 hours each). The dlcs are definitely at the same level of the main content, quality speaking. This game is good both for people who don't care about the plot and want to just smash everything and for the ones who instead are interested to it. Howewer, for the second ones, I strongly recommend to firstly play  Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition  and  Dark Souls II: Scholar of The First Sin , in order to understand what's going on (or just watching a Youtube video that explains it, if you don't wanna).I definitely suggest this game to anyone who likes the genre.  Personal scores             Graphics        Amazing                 Plot        Great                Gameplay        Good                Sound        Excellent                 Music        Amazing    If you have any questions for further information, feel free to ask. May the Flames guide thee ."

        "Comments": "Posted: December 9, 2016              'I am a Fire Keeper. I tend to the flame, and tend to thee. The Lords have left their thrones, and must be deliver'd to them. To this end, I am at thy side.âThe Fire Keeper__________________________________________IntroductionTo cut a long story short:  Dark Souls IIIâ is a great game and also a perfect start for anyone that has not played a 'Souls' game to date. From Software came up with interesting ideas to make weapons more diversified, the world and most of the levels are interesting and full of secrets and as usual thereâs a lot of hidden lore for people that are interested in story and motives. However from my point of view the game has also lost a bit of the atmosphere and 'essenceâ of the early 'Souls' games. Especially the feeling of hopelessness and solitude is even rarer than in 'Dark Souls II' and the difficulty of the journey changes a lot between challenging and cakewalk.According to director Miyazaki From Software will now focus on new projects and  Dark Souls III  will be the last 'Souls' game for the next years. On the one hand this is a sad message but on the other hand Iâm glad that the quality does not decrease with yearly new instances without many changes. __________________________________________The kingdom of Lothric and its tragic storyThe overall story is - as usual in a 'Souls' game - based around the cycle of Fire and Dark:Fire is fading and you have to return the five Lords of Cinder to their rightful thrones in order to link the fire once more.This time you are neither an Undead nor a Bearer of the Curse but an 'Unkindled Oneâ, born from the ashes of an Undead Warrior that failed on his mission. Everything is as ominous as ever and leads the protagonist into a long and dangerous journey through the kingdom of Lothric. There are lots of areas, items and names that link back to the precursors and there are some really atmospheric levels with great design and architecture and lots of hidden secrets and loot (Iâd like to mention 'Archdragon Peakâ, 'Lothric Castleâ and the 'Grand Archivesâ here). By the way: the game looks gorgeous. From Software was finally able to spice the game up with some beautiful graphics in addition to the fantastic style.Here are two screenshots to give you a better impression:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=744858087http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=741326897Sure, all 'Soulsâ games looked good due to their unique style but the amount of muddy textures was simply too damn high in the earlier titles.__________________________________________GameplayAside from the fact that the whole game feels a lot faster and agressive than the precursors there are some changes to spells and dual wielding in general and the new 'Weapon Artsâ.'From Software' brought the MP system from 'Demonâs Souls' back and went away from the fixed amount of casts. 'Ashen Estus Flasks' are used to recover the so called FP (Focus Points) and the 'Attunementâ stat now gives more FP in addition to attunement slots.  Moreover they changed the dual wielding system: Not every weapon can be used for dual wielding styles anymore, instead there are some specific 'Dual Wield Weaponsâ like e.g. the 'Brigand Twindaggersâ. Every Weapon has also a 'Weapon Artâ, a powerful special attack like a mighty blow or a useuful skill like e.g. a quickstep. Some of them are defined by the Weapon Class (e.g. the Weapon Art of most Straight Swords or Shields is the same) but some are truly unique. This gives some extra spice to several weapons and finally makes many of them feel more diversified aside from raw stats. __________________________________________Multiplayer and PVPFrom Software has finally included a password function for easier access to e.g. co-op games or fight clubs. Aside thereâs the usual stuff: several convenants with different goals, the summoning for bosses and areas and interesting/frustrating PVP that is always a difficult topic in the 'Soulsâ games. You can definitely rant hours and hours about it, especially about balancing and viable options. However I have to admit: When you get a 'goodâ opponent that plays a fair duel things can be a lot of fun despite the typical 'Git Gudâ-massacre. Unfortunately From Software dropped interesting convenant ideas like e.g. the Rat Convenant (you made others invade your world to lure them into a madhouse full of traps and enemies).__________________________________________ContraOne thing that bothers me a lot in this game is how it handles NG+. It's a massive step backwards compared to 'Dark Souls II' which did something amazing here: it changed stuff. In NG+ there were not only new drops to many bosses but also you were able to encounter a lot of new Phantoms in the areas, there were changes in some boss fights (e.g. the two Pyromancers during the Lost Sinner fight) and even stuff that surprised you completely like e.g. the two Pursuers in the Throne Room or the 'surprise attackâ of 'Dukeâs Dear Freja' on your way to Brightstone Cave Tseldora. This brought some variaton to the game, which was really needed in NG+ from my point of view. Unfortunately they left this out of 'Dark Souls III': Aside from upgraded rings that you can only find in NG+ and NG++, NG+ is exactly the same.Itâs a pity, those were fantastic ideas and a great start to a more 'diversified/changedâ NG+.Moreover I have to say: The game feels pretty easy from time to time. Sure some bosses give you a nice challenge when you fight them for the first time but afterwards I rarely had a problem. The feeling of winning after trying over and over was so rewarding and I kind of miss this for most parts of the game. Maybe thatâs the point - I already spent a lot of time in the 'Souls' games and earned a lot of experience. I guess for everyone that plays the series for the first time itâs still pure madness. A shame that thereâs no 'Champion Convenant' this time though.__________________________________________Conclusion'Dark Souls III' shows me once more why I love the series. Design, architecture and style of the world are fantastic, the gameplay is fluid and responsive and exploring the areas feels worthwhile. Moreover the lore is amazing and I love reading all the little hints and listen to the mysterious dialogues. There are some challenging areas and you are always happy when you find an interesting weapon or level up your character. Sure, aside from all the good facts I also mentioned many points that are - from my point of view - 'weakerâ than in the earlier titles. Not all changes are great, but that does neither mean that 'Dark Souls IIIâ is a bad game on its own nor that it is a bad 'Souls' games. Those are simply aspects where I think that they are weaker than before, but maybe I am a bit nostalgic here â as we all know there were always flaws in the 'Souls' series and stuff like balancing was always a difficult topic (e.g. the 'Scrapping Spearâ from Demonâs Souls). However 'Dark Souls IIIâ has its own style and atmosphere and that makes up for a lot. And moreover itâs way more accessible for new players and a great start for anyone to the whole 'Souls' series â you can respec your character, many of the bosses and enemies are more forgiving for mistakes and in PVE there's less ganking and less ambushes that simply frustrate you.Iâd rate it 9 out of 10 points on its own and maybe 8 out of 10 points as a 'Souls' game. Damn, maybe I have finally turned into one of those infamous Undeads that praises the first game(s) and hates on the successors.May the sun have mercy upon me.Praise the sun! This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers."

I was always put off from dark souls just thinking that it was a little to weird and out there for me to ever really give it a try. However giving Dark Sourls III a try was one of the best gaming decisions I've ever made. This game has some of the best combat I've ever experienced in any game and and the sense of adventure is amazing to experience. I have had more fun in this game than I have had in any other game in quite some time. I would highly recommend to anyone on the fense about playing this game to do it now. I truly do not think you will regret it."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 13, 2018              TL;DR - YES, it's good. NO, it's not nearly half as scary as you've been told. Don't be a chicken and give it a try. Probably wait until it's on sale though, the game certainly isn't new anymore.-Technical Stuffs-I'm running a pretty mediocre i5 processor, a mediocre 8GB of RAM, and an equally mediocre 2GB Radeon RX 460 GPU. I've set my graphics quality to 'high', which gets me a clean, steady 40 fps. I don't terribly mind, I can't really see the difference between 40 and 60 fps anyway. Dialing the settings back to 'medium' boosted my frames by an entire 5 fps on average, so that wasn't worth it.I haven't had any crashes yet and haven't encountered any bugs - the game runs perfectly fine for me. -Difficulty-Okay, let's get it out of the way. Is Dark Souls 3 difficult? I mean... kinda, and you'll almost certainly die a *lot*, but it's also very kind to its players.The thing is, DS3 very much expects you to royally mess up pretty much constantly, and it's balanced around that. You can suck as much as you want to, and you'll still be fine afterward; dying doesn't make you lose anything you can't regain fairly quickly.Just take every enemy seriously, even the most common of mooks and the freaking *tutorial enemies*, and don't bother being mad about dying, and you'll be fine.Winning is also never a mathematical impossibility - no matter how crappily you've leveled your character, you can still beat the game with it. Heck, some people take on the game at LV1 (and some even without equipment) *for fun*. I'm not saying it would be easy (because it REALLY would not be), but it's possible. So, seriously, don't be intimidated by the Souls-series' scary reputation; it's not fully warranted, and you're missing out on one hell of an experience. -Gameplay-First off: Yes, you can play DS3 with keyboard and mouse if you're used to that. You might want to put up a sticky note translating the shown (controller) keybinds if you have difficulty navigating the menus, but apart from that, KB/M is perfectly fine and occasionally very useful because it helps with camera management. Oof. What else to say? Melee combat, especially with a controller, is smooth as all hell. Magic is *fine*, but something Skyrim honestly does better. I'm happy with the gameplay, basically, but gameplay is generally not my main focus.-Visuals-OH MAN DS3 is a pretty game. Hardly anybody ever mentions that about Dark Souls, but the design of both characters (human-ish and monstrous alike) and environments is really, really good. The environments are dense, and the render distance and texture quality of far-away backdrops is positively ridiculous. I adore the cloth pysics in this game, too. On sale, you could easily buy the game for the visuals alone.(Only (three-second long) exception: Lothric's face when he resurrects his brother. DUDE, what happened to your high-definition facial textures? You look like you fell out of a very shoddily upscaled PS2 game!)-Audio-Yup. So much yup. Much of the game is surprisingly silent, but when there's music (mostly for the boss fights), it's *incredible*. Very epic, but also very fitting, and finely tailored to the circumstances in which the music plays. I'd listen to it all the time, but it gives me sudden feelings of dread.-Story and writing-Very sparse, but the things you can piece together from dialogue and item descriptions sound intriguing. NPCs tend to stay pretty flat and personality-less, with a few exceptions. Funnily enough, few people will agree on those exceptions. Few people will agree on *anything* in this series, but that's neither here nor there.The weirdest thing about Dark Souls in general is how everyone chuckles creepily every few lines. It's very strange, really.(also, the unironic use of 'thee' combined with the over-the-eyes headpiece of the Firekeeper reminds me of the Mouth of Sauron, and that's a mental image I *really* did not need)-Additional Comments: Visual Design, Worldbuilding-Yes, I'll ramble on about that some more.Everybody keeps raving about how  amazingly difficult  those games are, which never interested me much. You know what would've made me play those games *years* ago, though? Somebody mentioning that DS3 in particular is a highly unconventional look at what's essentially a post-apocalyptic world, or that you play various flavors of undead characters in all three games. That is SO AWESOME.DS3 also loves to contrast and combine purity and corruption, light and dark, holy and demonic in something that's pretty much my entire aesthetic in video game form. So many creepy, corrupted cathedrals! Evil angel knights! Morally dubious gods and equally morally dubious people worshipping a great many things! ALL the lovingly modeled Gothic architecture!Have I mentioned the amazing architecture yet? Sure, I'm a bit of an art and history nerd, but I've spent hours staring at pillars because they're so pretty. In DS3, reality and the space-time-continuum is completely falling apart, the world is stagnant and full of unchanging undead, aesthetically rotting, full of half-decayed wall hangings and carpets in gorgeous buildings, brittle gothic-inspired furniture everywhere... I love that so, so much. -Additional Comments: Community, Multiplayer-Multiplayer is divisive and the community tends to feel very strongly about pretty much everything; the tone is much rougher than in most other games I've played. It's stilly pretty fun, though, you just need a healthy sense of humor and the ability to keep your competitive nature in check. (Seriously, don't be That Guy, DS3 has way too many That Guys already)PvP matching is level-bound, so be sure to give it a try from the start; the higher your level, the more difficult starting out would be. You also get rather important items from PvP - you can farm them offline, there's nothing in the game that *requires* PvP... but having to farm those items is generally not a very fun time.-Additional Comments: Business Practices-You can get softbanned from online play for a large array of mostly harmless things (such as using camera mods in offline mode for screenshotting purposes), mostly without an option to rectify that. Some players have reported getting banned without being aware of doing anything wrong at all. FromSoft's solution to cheaters deliberately getting people softbanned amounts to  keep backups (which a handful of people have reported being banned for, of course) and don't get screwed over by cheaters . Real smooth, that. It's honestly the only real gripe I have with that game."

        "Comments": "Posted: December 14, 2017              So, I bought Dark Souls about 6 months after it came out on pc and well, I was not impressed. I initially didnât have a controller, even after I picked one up I just wasn't into the movement of Dark Souls. It felt so clunky. . It just seemed like lame, slow combat with no sick moves haha.  At the time I was playing Kingdoms of Amalur or another action/rpg like that. With my issues with the gameplay aside, I would have been down to stick it out and see what the game was about. However I quickly got frustrated with the so called difficulty of Dark Souls. The limiting bonfire system, no quest helper/tracker and the minimalist dialogue from the one npc at firelink made me just give up. I didn't see much of a story and what I did see was about as convoluted a story as I had seen.With all of the frustration I had with Dark Souls I admit I still found it intriguing. I said to myself if they âfixâ the movement and gameplay then Iâll give the series another shot. And so I waited, wanting to explore this acclaimed series but trying to find a more accessible entry point. Dark Souls 2 came out and I was tempted but still apprehensive.I bought Bloodborn on PS4 played it for 10 minutes and never played it again. My fault. And then Dark Souls 3 came out, finally, the âmodernâ souls game I was looking for.*********Spoilers**********************Obviously, I waited for a Steam sale. I finally purchased Dark Souls 3. I was hoping that this would be a way for me to get into the Souls universe. I remembered the vague and cryptic story I had experienced and I was stoked to get into this. So I started up Dark Souls 3 (again without a controller) and after 3 hours I got past Iudex, the first boss. I was excited by the movement being much smoother and also frustrated by the keyboard.  So I proceeded on with the game, moving onto Lothric Castle. I quickly became frustrated with the controls and I just could not progress, knightâs op versus keyboard. So I went out and bought an Xbone controller. I also started watching a letâs play on YouTube. I was determined to give this game all I had this time. I slowly proceeded to get better and more comfortable with the game and the combat. I died to probably every single enemy in that castle.   My deaths, at that time, were far more stupendous than my kills. Die to the Dragon. Die to the skeletons next to the dragon. Die to the Knight after the skeletons. Die to the terrifying-possessed-zombie-thing next to the knight. I learned a valuable lesson with all that dying. Never underestimate an enemy.     A combination of fear and excitement made me slowly progress to the first REAL boss. As I finally encountered this beast I have to admit, I was awestruck. That thing is badass! And he proceeded to ground me into dust. Heâs huge heâs strong and heâs fast? How do I kill this thing? I went in knowing this was gonna take a few tries.  Haha, after the tenth time I was ready. I knew this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s moves and he was going down! Popped an ember andâ¦ You Died.  Four more times and I finally owned that beast, the satisfaction was great, and, the relief of the bonfire was greater. Whew!âSo this is Dark Souls?â I thought.âThis is hard. But doable.â I ventured forth looking to own some more heirs of fire. I rambled through the next areas trying to figure everything out as I went, but I would also be watching my trusty letâs play youtuber to share in my pain and triumphs. That really helped me as the Dark Souls mood can really creep you out! As I slowly grew more powerful, I dabbled in pyromancy. I found my first Ultra Greatsword. I found side bosses and explored and learned about this tragic world. Making my way through the middle of the game, I began to see some of the beauty of the world. There are some truly amazing sites in this game. Irithyll Valley. Anor Londo. So cool.The bosses! Abyss Watchers. Pontiff Sulyvhan. The Dancer. Demons. DraGONS. GiANTS!!! WowSo here I am now, just sitting in Archdragon Peak waiting to find the courage to beat the Nameless King. And so now, coming full circle, Dark Souls 3 has made me decide to play Dark Souls again. Just to give it another shot. Now, Iâm a level 38 Pyromancer heading down to the catacombs. Been enjoying the hell out of it. Not as smooth as Dark Souls 3 but definitely great. This game is one of the best gaming experiences Iâve ever had. I really canât say enough about this game.Thank you From Software!"

We kinda felt the duty to accomplish our mission and sacrifice ourself in order to not make their past vain, becoming nothing but a puppet in the hands of gods.Later, we discover that everything was useless.Dark Souls 2 - Nobody remember anymore of the Four Lords, just their souls remained in this corrupted world, Drangleic, four powerfull souls from the Lands of Lordran.King Vendrick is looking for a way in order to win the curse, and it seems he managed a way to stop it, but not to heal it. In the meanwhile his brother Aldia, scholar of the First Sin, discover the real cause of the curse: a seal created from Gwyn in order to keep the first flame alive. This is the First Sin of the Gods, their want not to die.After we  kill  Aldia, he tells us the most important thing of the series: But the question remains.. What do you want, truly? Light, Dark, or something else entirely? Dark Souls 3 - The flame is now fading in a way that never been before. Lothric refused to link the Fire, that's why bells called for us, champion of Ashes, the resemblance of all the failures of the past. We must find the Lords of Cinder and make them linking the fire, no cares how we manage to do it. During our journey, someone is looking after us: the black church of Londor, descendant of Kaathe's will. We discover that we can usurp the First Fire and give it to the Real Darkness, becoming the Lord of the new age of Humanity.The path of the big betraial, where we cover all the past with ashes in order to break the cycle of the Fire and creating something completely new, an age without Gods, only humans, and gentil darkness..So here we are, at the real Kiln of the First Flame once again, fighting the manifestation of all the cursed ones who decided to sacrifice for the Age of Fire, for their Gods.A fight beetwen the traitors and the serves of Gods, the last fight.Once we manage to win the Soul of Cinder, here something happens.He revives.Nor his body, just His will to not be forgotten.Lord Gwyn, the first lord of Cinder. His soul is still here, fighting for the last time trying to keep the Fire alive.But everything is useless, 'cause every fire will turn to Ashes.And so the flame will fade, and so the world will be merged from grey, silent ashes.Meanwhile, a strange painter is making his last paint, imaging a new cold, dark and gentle world. A world painted with the blood of the Dark Soul, the same souls that tried to emerge all this time, the same caotic soul that wanted freedom from the seal of Light, the seal of Fire.A new, dark world, where Dark Souls could be free.That's the story of many of us, the story of choices, different paths who converged into the same, peacefull end, 'cause everything will vanish, every flame will fade.Thanks Miyazaki, and all the working team.Thanks From Software, and absolutely thanks to all the players who lived in this trilogy."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 11, 2016              Into the Deep EndAs a Dark Souls newbie, this game was extremely punishing at first and tested my patience to the next level. Never have I been forced to realize how bad I am at combat. True, unadulterated, combat. The kind where it is your fault for going in too deep when the enemy was preparing an attack. Where slowing down and observing is just important as attacking. Death after death, and then some more for good measure, I finally managed to take down Iudex (the starting boss)â¦down to his second phase. Of course he had to have a second phase, I mean, itâs only been 5 minutes since I created my character and this guy is more difficult than most gamesâ final bosses. Alright fine, letâs try it againâ¦.and naturally, the stupid skeleton guarding the boss entrance chunked me for half of my health. This obnoxious heathen never managed to hit me in my previous 16 runs, but now its eyes gained some sort of holy enchantment to make every arrow land on my back. This is the type of game DARK SOULS III is. One without mercy, care, or pity. It took me approximately 2 hours to beat Iudex as a starting Mercenary, but the thrill and adrenaline post-battle was truly something no other game offered. Who knew I could come to love a game that wanted to kill me so badly.Ashes, Cinders, and BonfiresAs I fought my way through the story, I began to become immersed with the lore and progression system. Every single itemâs description, name, and method of acquisition imparts just a tiny bit of knowledge or history onto the player. At first, most of this information is useless at worst, or intriguing at best. These little puzzle pieces manage to eventually paint a very vivid and dark image about the world of Lothric and its inhabitants. Ashes and unique equipment often detail the previous ownersâ qualities; a gift to fans of previous games in the series. Although DS III is fairly disconnected with any of the other SOULS games, certain NPCs and discoveries will tie up loose ends and provide closure for particular aspects of the first DARK SOULS game.Unlike the previous games, bonfires are placed just when you truly need them, and most important of all, teleportation between bonfires are available from the get-go. Firelink Shrine, the base of operations of sorts, serves as the location for player stat upgrades, weapon upgrades/infusions, Estus flask upgrades, and bonfire upgrades (increases healing per flask). Similar to Humanity or Human Effigies from the previous games, Ember heals the player and boosts max health in exchange for allowing human and NPC invasions.Although the world design is fairly spectacular, it was mostly linear/bi-linear (city with a dungeon below it) with moderate exploration required for completionists. The traditionally grand map comprised of interconnecting smaller maps through shortcuts is replaced with a more direct route, however, the world is still HUGE. In fact, without proper investigation, it is extremely easy to completely miss 4 optional areas with their own bosses. In total, there are 19 bosses that will do their best to make sure life in Lothric is a living Hell, along with several other mini-bosses in between. The grunt and fluff type enemies are never too difficult â just strong enough to warrant consistent player attention. The extremely well planned level and boss design (excluding a couple) easily makes DS III one of the most memorable games I have ever played. I can clearly recount most of the paths in every area along with every bossesâ movesets and shenanigans. From clones and body doubles, to massive variances in combat range and aggressiveness, the boss fights and surrounding environements are truly, and remarkably, unforgettable.The Art in KillingOne of the most noticeable changes to the tried-and-true combat involves the introduction of weapon arts. Think of it as a special skill move belonging to certain weapon types. Hacking and slashing is always fun, but turning that long sword into a propeller of death is even more so. Special and boss type weapons are often imbued with properties of their wielder, including a unique weapon art that can be so hauntingly beautiful to perform. Lance thrusts with bursts of electricity, sword strikes covered in fire, and duel-wielded weapons moving in an artistic dance are only some of what you will see. Unfortunately, most of these arts require the use of FP (focus points), and once out, they wonât be usable until replenished.Issues & UpdatesDS III launched with quite a few minor grievances, mostly sporadic FPS drops, but all of them have been fixed. The only major issue at the moment is regarding softbanning due to âData Inconsistenciesâ which may occur due to advancing in the game offline (de-syncing with the server) or from online hackers. Continuous patches have been applied since the posting of this review in order to keep up to date with the demanding pvp balance and bug encounters.VerdictI canât stress enough how much I really enjoyed playing DS III. This game is one of my personal contenders for 2016 GOTY. I really regret never playing the earlier two during their heyday, but at least it gives me something to do while i lament the end of this great journey â at least, until the Season Pass content gets released. For those that want to continue into New Game +, DS III fortunately provides 3 other endings with vastly different consequences to uncover, increasing replayability immensely. One of those endings also requires an extremely strict quest-line progression, ultimately leading to one of the most shocking moments in the game!Before You Buy â analyses of newly released indie games"

Fun, beautiful, interesting story, it has it all. Co-op is extremely amusing and all the bosses are fun to fight albeit sometimes a bit aggrivating as aren't prepared. I give the game a 9/10, that 1 is just for that one time I died from a cliff"

He watched from afar, clapping and lying down as I ungraciously beat everything around me to death. Once I was done I approached the phantom. He bowed and two-handed a shield. I bowed as well and two handed my greatshield. We fought using only our shields, nothing around us but the sound of clanking and tiny blood spurts as we slowly damaged each other. In the end, I was victorious, but I will never forget you kind shield man."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 14, 2016              Spoiler free reviewIf you didn't enjoy the quality of Dark Souls II and are wondering about the enjoyment of Dark Souls III and the fact that it may be overhyped, worry no longer.Dark Souls III is the true successor to Dark Souls.The third entry in a game series renowned for its outstanding unique storytelling and its sinister difficulty, FromSoftware has brought us again another game worthy of praise. Taking place in the land of Lothric, you will encounter grotesque beasts of the unknown, epic bosses, the most beautiful environments and a lore deeper than any ocean. If you are tired of hand-holding games where the game seems to shove tutorials in your face even to end-game than this is the game for you. Dark Souls is NOT a HARD game.One of the reason that I hold Dark Souls in such high regard is not because of the difficulty but rather the fact that it doesn't treat the player as if they're a child. The game will punish you but know that it doesn't mean the end, rather every death you face is nothing more than a stepping stone to a greater success, a hard earned success is honestly the greatest feeling ever. You will learn new skills and eventually adapt, the game knows you aren't stupid and will treat you like you are; a human, something a lot of games these days are sorely missing.DifferencesAgain, Dark Souls III feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls I than II ever did. Borrowing things from all their previous games you will see happy changes to the overall game. Fans of Demon Souls will be happy to know that the hub world shares an uncanny resemblance to the Nexus as well as the Maiden. Extremely well designed bosses inspired from the creatures of Bloodborne and its engine as well as Dark Souls II's accessibility to the series.Positives:    CAMEOS! Returning characters will make appearances.    Extremely well optimized.    Keyboard and Mouse controls aren't that bad.    There is now no permanent health loss when dying.    Amazing soundtrack that will soothe your ears.    Extremely well designed boss fights.    Full of amazing locations to explore.     Great level design.    Rewarding difficulty.    Playing CO-OP with a specific player is very easy now.    Stances. Combat has been reworked for the better.    No more Soul Memory.    Interesting NPCs, to encounter and converse with.    PVP is better than it ever was.    Classes don't lock you into anything, you can make your build into anything you want, e.g. magic user.    World fits together nicely in a way that makes sense.    Open world, areas are massive.    Approachable systems, deep and very easy to learn and master.    Mage builds are rethinked, they aren't as broken and overpowered like in Dark Souls II.    Matchmaking is a breeze.    This is NOT the final Souls game.    BACKSTABS ARE BACK! At the very least better executed than in Dark Souls II.    You can easily switch between OFFLINE mode & ONLINE mode now.Negatives:    Though rarely, at the moment there is a few framerate hiccups but other than that PC version is very well done.    Somewhat noticeable pop-ins.    The world isn't inter-connected like in Dark Souls I which may upset some.    CAMEOS! Though I've written it as a plus, some may dislike it as some may think of it as lazy where From could've very well created new and interesting characters.    Not necessarily a negative but having an unstable connection while online will bring you back to the main menu.  Is this game worth it?Yes, very much so! Though I am biased, this is truly an amazing game. It doesn't matter if you are a veteran, new or old, Dark Souls III takes the best part of all of From's previous games and makes it even better. It surpassed my expectations, even more it completely destroyed what I should expect from a game. All upcoming games, Triple A especially take note, this is how you make a game. This is a true game.Thank you kindly, Alex for giving me the chance to play this wonderful game."

Negatives: - Sometimes framerate drops but not too often.- Areas aren't connected like in Dark Souls I. But it's not a big deal.- IMO some of the bosses need a little buff. Summary As a Souls  veteran  this is the best Souls game in my books this is just amazing piece of work to be honest i didn't even expect this much. FromSoftware did amazing job and hopefully it doesn't end here.This is how you make a game.Buy this game. BUY IT NOW."

Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is!Dark Souls III was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience.People always say Dark souls is difficult, Dark Souls is hard. But it really isn't. It's challenging. It requires your attention. Masterful architecture, stunning graphics, wonderful level design, full of shorcuts and the fights. The tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison.Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Every bosses were unique and well designed. TBH the bosses are so good that you feel honored to be killed by them. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning!10/10 for me"

But I kept thinking about the game, and when it went on sale recently I decided to give it another try. I just kept at it, inspired by the Idle Thumbs playthrough, and now I'm almost 60 hours into this character and I love it. It may be one of my favorite games of all time. Sometimes it's infuriating, but oh man, when you finally power through whatever boss or obstacle is holding you back, it's an amazing feeling. Give it a try and don't give up on the first day like I did the first time I tried it. It's worth it. I'm thinking about getting the DLC and I simply never purchase DLC for anything."

When you step into dark souls 3 prepare to die alot... this game will make you tilted on a new kind of level. but the feeling when you finally beat that boss or finally clear that area is insane. Thankyou for making dark souls 3 my favorite game ever. i would recommend this game to anyone i know, but i will always give out the warning that this game IS NOT CASUAL. Graphics are great, gameplay is amazing, pve is challenging, pvp is hardcore, the system of invasions is amazing and will make you shiver everytime  you see that message pop up.Overall 10/10 Best game i ever played."

Solid 60fps in all areas.) and the game has not crashed, bugged, glitched, trashed my frame-rate, cut my audio or done anything else that is being stated by some users (I'm not claiming that it's not happening, though).With that being saidDark Souls 3 is probably my favorite Souls so far when it comes to gameplay. Combat is fast (not as Bloodborne, but just enough to make things more interesting), fluid and thrilling. Enemies are faster, more aggressive and smarter, too. This time, you have Weapon Arts, which are different skills and movesets for several weapons in the game, that when used, consume Focus Points. Yes, the Demon's Souls Mana bar is back. The level design is SO GOOD this time, although it's not as interconnected as Dark Souls 1, it's big to the point of making you feel lost.  I haven't completed Dark Souls 3 yet, but thus far, it has been one of the best experiences I had since The Witcher 3 came out!"

I've always had an approach to this series like a typical newbie. I never played, I always thought that this game is difficult.I do not have to say HOW I was VERY wrong and how much I have lost over the years.2. ReviewThis game is addictive and satisfying, only some souls-like and rogue-like games can match. However, the games from the Dark Souls series offer an unforgettable atmosphere, constant anxiety, but also fascination and fulfillment.The game offers a lot of combinations of builds thanks to a large number of armor sets, weapons, classes, spells, statistics, fighting styles, and special abilities.There is so much that I do not want to write about it anymore.Regarding the soundtrack, I have never heard the greatest music in the main menu and at some matches, maybe only the one from The Witcher 3 can match. Subtle, motivational, climatic, UNFORGETTABLE!The quality of non-player character voices is the highest class, I have not heard such a good voice act in a long time!Multiplayer is quite specific, can be liked or not. Calling other players to help at the same time exposing yourself to the invasion of hostile players is ... original.Unfortunately, if someone is accustomed to the classic co-op and passing the game with a friend, he may feel a little disappointed. Every time you die and use the checkpoint, you must repeat the monotonous procedure.There are so many secrets to discover, so many connections and dependencies that without a guide you can easily overlook something. Still, I recommend playing this game twice, once for the experience, the second time to test another build, discover the secrets, take part in even more demanding challenges.You can go through this game several times and still discover something and of course still feel satisfaction!Unforgettable defeats and victories, getting to know new opponents, learning new tactics, etc. Everything will stay in my memory for many years!Now I'm able to believe that Dark Souls games can change a human being to a certain extent.Praise The Sun!"

Quit the game for 30mins or more, then come back and try again. Or try again the next day.Dont cheat and DONT lookup on the internet for guide, maps, tips or weapon location, et cetera.I know Its tempting to googling for all the secrets and hidden paths, or location for all items and armors. But leave that for your 2nd playthrough. The less you know, the more you gonna enjoy the game. I bet on my life that A LOT of people would wish to play any Souls game for the first time again. Lastly, if you havent play the original DS, please do."

It might be relaxing, refreshing and you enjoy it but it might also be too hot so you burn yourself and die. I really enjoy the feeling when my skin is burning and starts to peel off so I can see my red flesh and bones. Every time the screen says  YOU DIED  my heart skips a beat and I remember why I love this game so much."

I really enjoy the combat, audio, and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren't great, it plays well with a controller.The world design is pretty good, but seems a bit linear. There are connections and shortcuts throughout the game, but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game. The ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity, since it would take ages to move from an area to the other, just by running. The story is told in a great way, for those who take their time to analyze and actually  study  the game environment. Storytelling is done throughout the game by environments, enemy placements, items description, drops, so on and so forth. Basically every element of this game is telling a story. This game is great. Would recommend it? Definitely."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 24, 2018              Before playing this I started with first Dark Souls (not on Steam though) and what can I say - I had to spend a few evenings just to complete the tutorial part of the game since I couldn't figure out how to put a shield in the hands of my character and use it to protect myself. Also had no idea there's autolock so you can probably understand by now that this made the game even harder for me than it was designed initially. I swear to god I would abandon this game if I was 11 or something, but being an adult makes you stubborn and gives you that special  I need to finish this  feeling about everything you start doing.I've spent around a year trying to beat the game and had most problems with Ornstein & Smough. Evening after evening I tried to make my character stronger to actually be able to survive this massacre. I played this for a few hours, got despaired and switched to other games. Sometimes I abandoned playing for weeks or even months. But eventually I was able to complete this and it felt like one of the biggest accomplishments in any video game I played so far. I've never had an experience like that before and I loved it.Dark Souls 3 appeared to be less challenging since I was able to call for help anytime I wanted and being lazy in nature I didn't hesitate to do this. It felt like cheating but it's really hard to torture yourself knowing that this can be done in a few minutes with the help of a few pro players. This way I could actually enjoy playing the game and it became more of a relaxing experience since I don't always want to be destroyed in moral way after having a hard day at work which happened a lot at that time. This was also the first time I used the multiplayer aspect of the game and it felt good but also punishing since my fighting tactics usually sucks comparing to what people usually do when they play this game.Overall I feel that DS3 is like DS1 on steroids, at he same time it was easier for me in many ways and I was able to complete it much faster than DS1, which isn't bad but at the same time the fact that I can get help almost any time stole part of the fun I had while playing DS1. The bottom line here is that one definitely should play this game if s/he liked DS1, but I suggest avoiding getting help from other players if you want to get similar experience."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 27, 2018              I quite enjoyed DARK SOULS III. Although the world is not as branching and connected as DARK SOULS I there are some areas that do have a similar flow to them, where one bonfire joins several paths together through the use of shortcuts. The gameplay is incredibly fast and fluid in comparison to the first two Dark Souls games, something that I was not prepared for during the early hours of the game. I loved the game so much I kept going until I had unlocked every achievement.I know some players took issue with the amount of throwbacks and references to the previous games with recurring characters, locations, and items from the previous two Dark Souls, even Demon's Souls, but I didn't mind at all. The original Dark Souls is the end of the beginning so by the time DARK SOULS III comes around there is an established ritualistic and recursive behaviour in regards to the fading flame. Just like in real life where the world is constantly changing, each civilisation's forgotten history falling victim to entropy, so has the world of DARK SOULS III.DARK SOULS III is difficult but far easier and simpler game to play than the original. Player movement is so fluid and the amount of invulnerability offered when dodge rolling is a huge boon to the player, it's hard not to view it as an exploit. I never bothered with PvP in the previous games but that changed here; after overcoming my nerves I found it incredibly addicting to the point where I'd stay up until 4am messing around as a Mad Phantom just to confuse the players I'd invade.While DARK SOULS III does have its issues in regards to broken mechanics - such as poise not working properly, hackers, and wonky collision systems - it manages to improve on the formula due to some necessary quality of life changes and technical optimisation. I consider DARK SOULS III to be a seriously amazing game, a satisfying closure to the series, and I hope never to see it revived."

I expected a difficult journey (though I wouldnt know just how difficult), and gameplay similar to games like The Witcher, Skyrim, or Dragon Age. What I ended up getting was a game that made me feel like I was handed a sword and told to explore this insanely unforgiving, relentless, and utterly merciless game. A game that makes you feel like you were handed a sword.Imagine if - with all your years of fantasy game experience - you were handed an actual sword and told you face this world. Do you think you would be good? No, we would all mostly get pounded left and right. This is what Dark Sousl 3 does to you. It's not your typical fantasy, where you feel like you know how to play and  you got this . Dark Souls 3 casts a feeling of helplessness and feelings of unfamiliarity into a seemingly familar journey. Dark Souls isn't your average hack and slash fantasy but a dark, dark, unforgiving bully that will never spare you. This game will kick your legs in and then continue to kick you while you're down, and it couldn't be better. Not only are the graphics impeccable, the mood is enough to make you go wow. Not only that, but learning about the lore could be a game on its own, deeply sown within each item description, enemy, and place you visit, are inklings of game plot and lore.Bosses are relentless and will slaughter you and your dreams with brutality and the strength you wish you had. You will be crushed time and time again, but this game is like drugs, and you will continue to come back for more, whether it be for vegeance, pride, or anger. There are so many weapons to be found, views to be sought out, friends to be made, people to rescue, magic to learn, bosses to defeat, stories to be heard, secrets to be discovered, blood to be bled, and souls to be lost.Your armor will be your comfort, your weapons will be your arsenal, your spells will be your plan B. You will nervously dodge, fail to parry, attack too early, attack too late, miss attacks, run out of stamina, and desperately run,  this game is like bootcamp.I recommend Dark Souls 3 to anyone who is a fan of the Fantasy genre, likes a challenge, isn't afriad to back down, and has the vigor to push on. Praise the sun!"

        "Comments": "Posted: October 16, 2017              Q: Give me a TL;DR version.A: Buy the game and git gud.Q: I heard the game is hard. Is it good for causal player?A: Yes.Q: Is it good for Skyrim player?A: Yes, but you'll need to learn new mechanics such as parrying and roll timing.Q: Is it a good game for family, friend etc?A: Yes. The game has a password feature to co-op with friend. I think the game is educational for children, as it teaches people to not give up and overcome hardship.Q: Is this game full of rainbow and candy?A: No, it's closer to a horror game, especially in some later areas. Even prettier areas are infested with monsters. The atmosphere of this game is very grim and grey-ish.Q: Tutorial?A: Check the signs in the first map. You can check the keyboard-controller maping in setting. The first map has mooks, a mini boss and a boss for you to play with. The tutorial boss, Gundyr, teaches you various evasion technique.Q: Is there a mini map?A: No. But since you might die a number of times you'll get familiar with the map. There are many shortcuts.Q: Is there an easy mode?A: It's called greatshield, you can get one in the second map but need some levelling up to use it. Starting as knight (default) also counts as an easy mode in early game.Q: I don't like invaders.A: Start the game in offline mode, you can change this in setting. You can still play with NPC phantoms but cannot co-op. If you are online, stay unembered prevent invasion but you cannot co-op. If you are invaded you can also run toward the boss fog gate. Edit: you can join Way of Blue in the second map, that will lower the chance of being invaded as well.Q: Mooks attack 100 times in a row.A: Try spacing.Q: Mooks gank me. Unfair!A: Try looking around, this game is known for enemy trolling you every corner. Lock on feature will spot enemy above.Q: Bosses are too fast.A: It's kind of counterintuitive, but you sometimes need to roll toward them. Check Youtube if you have trouble. Don't worry, dying to boss is a learning process.Q: What's the main strength of this game?A: Best video game soundtrack.Q: What's the weakness of this game?A: Too short compared to DS2, not enough armor/weapon/spells.Q: Should I buy DS1 and DS2 instead?A: DS1 is more noob friendly IMO, and a better defined story. DS2 has many different mechanics, better PvP but terrible PvE ganking. It's completely up to you.Q: Will I feel confused by the story when jumping directly into the third game?A: The story is always vague, so it doesn't matter. Check Youtube lore channels for better understanding.Q: I've heard that NPC questlines are hard to complete without guide.A: Just talk to people and do what they say, check the shrine to see if there are new dialogue. One thing you need to remember is that progressing in Rosaria's Finger (a guild, you cannot equip the guild item or offer the leveling item) will end another questline. Also the magic merchant will leave if you ignore your promise.Q: I'm a completionist. What if I miss some gear?A: You need to reach NG++ for 100% achievement, so feel free to look online for checklist in NG+."

We win the fight against this trio and proceed further to the bridge with the stairs where I was close to die a few times , yet we reach the end of the stairs and there is a room with a fog wall.I saw a summon sign so I summoned it , it was  Sirris of the Sunless Realms  a true NPC .I go through the fog and soon they come too, we fight with this boss  Lorian,Elder Prince  where I was trying to learn his mechanics , finally we won .Or at least that's what I though , the  we won  wasn't actually a win because the boss wasn't dead , it was only the first phase of it .We looked doomed , Sirris  was almost dead and I had only half of hp , 1 etsus flusk and  1 divine blessing. But we fight and fight , I get knocked a few times by the mechanics which I didn't knew. Yet  Myla  was fighting with his/her dagger a boss  whom he know that it was my first time. We tried to aggro the boss , one by one , he was hitting him a few times , getting his aggro and then I was doing the same trying to do my best.Even if it looked over I fought with only 20% hp while the boss had half on the second phase.In the end our struggles pay off.The boss is dead , we rejoice with our gestures and spamming the animation for the empty etsus flusks.While I light the bonfire I realize that I had 261320 souls and later I realize that I've just beat the last Lord of Cinder  Lothric, Younger Prince  whom he was in phase two of the boss.And this my friend is the story of my CO-OP journery in Dark Souls 3 with a  Thief  whom had only a dagger, a journey that I won't forget so soon.Edit:Fun fact :I had my Estus Flask at +0 ,because I didn't knew that you could make + (Later I've found out through some wiki)"

Itâs a fierce and punishing behemoth that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back, again and again and again. But with a bleak, yet beautiful world thatâs enthralling to explore and packed with secrets to find, I always felt compelled to come back, eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges.Dark Souls 3 does suffer from occasional framerate dips and a few underwhelming boss fights, but beyond that, its epic scale, aggressive obstacles, and rich development of existing lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet."

The combat (which is the real 'meat and potatoes' of the game) is great fun, challenging yes, but the game is designed in such a way that its almost always worth one more go.You try, you fail, you improve slighty, repeat 5 times, achieve success, dopamine is released, you realise its 2am, you feel shame."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 10, 2017              I cannot say much of anything which has not already been said about this game. But who can stop the provocated hands of a writer? I can add scarcely anything but praise which already exists in excess for this game. But, as a newcomer to the series, this review, then, by default is primarily, though not exclusively for newcomers such as myself.Everything about this game, from the gameplay, the graphics, the vague PvP, to the yet vaguer story/ lore is something intense, something which stands apart from the vast array of titles which are paraded onto the digital and retail marketplaces. And although everything about this game is intense, nothing seems forced.. The voice acting done is insanely good, I mean, there are splendid baritones of the men and also the soft lullaby voices of the women.It is simply a treat to walk through the world of Lothric, 'a land of monstrosities', which is a world fallen into ruin. Not just the visuals but also the music is simply amazing, just perfectly fitted for each moment, there exists a piece of music for this game.Dark Souls III does everything well, including its silence, we...are silent, we speak nothing, we have no voice and it would be a joke to call ourselves the protagonist, we are just an undead on a forsaken quest for which we won't be thanked or remembered. It brings out the stark and lovely misery, in many ways, it is much like real life struggle of real life heroes. Some of the stories, nay, most of the lore of the bosses and NPC's are deeply moving, and there exist a plethora of videos on YouTube if you want to delve deeper into their sorrow and mull and wallow in sadness. The choice of weapons, armour is also something worth mentioning. You can even don the armour of the bosses you defeat which also plays a part in the greater irony of the world. And yet more tragic, in some sense is the soul transposition concept with which we can make weapons out of the souls of the bosses we fell.But the defining characteristic, the thing for which even casual gamers such as myself reach back time and again into the game, is the GAMEPLAY, which is absolutely brilliant. It cannot be compared to anything, things are, indeed compared to the SOULS gameplay. The combat, the management and investment of stats (RPG perspective), the quests you take, the friends you make, the routines you break...Each button press, each light attack, each special move, each dodge, each and every movement and action that you make the character do is important, it is more than a pattern, it is not merely repetition, it is getting skilled, gaining confidence and familiarity and then going in and getting through which fills you with fulfilment and contentment.Even the abstract lore and story is presented in such a poetic and beautiful way that one cannot help but probe further into it, through the sources which the game itself provides, stringing together clues, piecing together fragments of scraps from descriptions and dialogues. But the curiosity which is invoked by the subtlest of hints is something which made me, at least become a fan of lore videos which plentifully plague YouTube.The essence and SOUL of Dark Souls III lies in the way it retains its uniqueness despite everything being compared to it. The only con, I think, is that nothing really, can live up to the Souls experience...and that, like almost everything that we truly love, is tragic."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 6, 2016              DARK SOULS PVP NITPICKING - EVERYONE HAS ALREADY COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS  EDITIONGRAIN OF SALT WARNING: This post is by an idiot who played over 1000 hours of Dark Souls 2 and Scholar of the First Sin, most of which were PVP hours at the upper soulmemory tiers.As far as PVE goes, it's pretty good!  Nice places, wide selection of weapons from the get-go, you know the drill.  Everyone is basically in agreement that the PVE is a return to DS1 form and is generally lovely, though personally I think the locations are not quite as fantasy-tastic as DS1 or DS2.  Personal opinion there; YMMV.The PVP is another matter.  Again, fair warning; some of these might just be my cheese being moved, but as a guy who got to know the combat in DS2 fairly deeply, I am annoyed that a lot of clever things were disposed of.  It's not a world-shatteringly terrible affair, but it seems curious to me that several of the lessons FromSoft learned from DS2's two-year-long PVP balancing fiasco were either forgotten or ignored, including but not limited to:- No weapon turncaps.  Any weapon can track a full 180deg after the first attack; in DS2, things like thrusting swords and spears had their tracking limited so that their advantages (range, speed) were offset by poor tracking; without these restrictions, these weapons become much stronger since their narrow hitbox will almost always be where you want it to be without punishing you if you are wrong.- Faster combat.  This is not a bad thing!  The way it interacts with the famously spotty netcode is.  Certain weapons have very fast running or rolling attack animations, and a poor connection can lead to you not even seeing several initial frames of an attack, making certain weapons irritatingly overpowered (I'm looking at you, katana running attacks (and the people who play (very successfully!) with nothing but this one attack)).  This also makes phantom range a bigger problem than it was.- No poise.  I know  poise  is in the game as some bizarre mechanic that governs i-frame loss, but that is some small potatoes.   Hyper-armor as a general purpose poise replacement is not all bad; it makes some STR-focused weapons very viable, but certain fast and light weapons (estoc, duh) are more effective than anything else simply because they can be doing damage before you have a chance to get to your weapon's hyper-armor frames as a counter.  Personally, I find this problem is the worst with the Farron Greatsword - its weapon art move hits for a decent bit of damage and is a guaranteed stunlock, but the stun comes long before the damage thanks to the myriad of hits apparently accomplished by breakdancing.  The weapon effectively has a fast weapon's hitstun timing and a midsize weapon's damage, which is an irritating pairing when added to the eons long stunlock.- No backstep iframes.  I straight-up don't see people backstep anymore.  I'm a proponent of the  more options/higher skill ceiling  school of thought, and though some people exploited backsteps to the point of being irritating cheese in DS2, I miss having a good portion of my weapon's moveset being viable and not just an extended, predictable setup.  With the faster combat/netcode combo, nobody can expect to evade a hit from another player with a backstep since they'll just hit the space where you were, doing damage without fail.- No aimable running attacks or backstep attacks.  You could do some really nifty stuff with large weapons and manually aiming backsteps and running attacks, but now running attacks are only PVP viable with very fast weapons.  Certain weapons with a running charge for a running attack have a teeeeeeeny allowance for changing direction, but it's so small that it's trivial.  Combine this with no iframes for backsteps and you lose a lot of options for skilled play.- Nerfed offhand moveset.  In DS2, you could do any attack with your left handed weapon that you could with your right, excluding ripostes and other crits.  Now, the only moves your offhand weapon can perform are light attacks and either a guard or a parry (or spells but that's obvious) depending on what you have equipped.  Curiously, when equipping a weapon with an offhand parry move, L1 attacks and L2 parries as expected, but when using any other weapon, L1 guards and L2 is the attack button.  Why FromSoft thought anyone would want to guard with a 1handed weapon or have the input commands mixed up like this is completely beyond my ken.  Again, less options.- No attack cancels.  This sword cuts both ways; you don't see the game or players doing something that obviously shouldn't be possible, which is a pet peeve of mine that I grudgingly put aside for the sake of fun, but you also miss out on a lot of headgames that ultimately decide fights between skilled players.  Cancels were the redemption of large weapons in DS2, and while hyper armor on any weapon larger than a stick is not a bad tradeoff, it still feels like the easy way out as far as making big weapons viable goes.  Less options!- Nerfed guard-breaks.  This seriously rewards extremely defensive play which is SUPER BORING and exhausting.  Greatshields are supposed to be great at being shields; that's perfectly fine!  To not be able to counter one without a whip is not fine.  People did perfectly infuriating jobs of being obnoxious and effective turtles back in DS2 when one guardbreak could swat the shield aside, and now it is much much easier.- Removal of several key gestures.  This might seem trivial, but a large portion of a player's  vocabulary  was nixed for some reason.  There are now a million ways to say  Hello!  and  I'm a smarmy jerk!  Look at how bad you are!  but FromSoft removed the ability to say  No  with the No Way gesture, they removed the Mock gesture which was a great way to express confusion, they removed the It's Me! gesture which was the best thing since sliced bread, and they removed the Righty-Ho! which was just great and I miss it.  At least we got the clap and the  here's my elbow  and anri's pretentious slow-walk emote!- Broken Covenants.  This doesn't affect everyone, but IT AFFECTS ME AND I AM AS CHEESED AS I CAN BE ABOUT A SMALL PORTION OF A VIDEOGAME.  Basically, some people get summoned to covenants that autosummon you and some people just don't, and apparently it's determined by the steam account that owns the game, primarily affecting early purchasers (as far as I can tell).  Move your file over to family sharing and there's no problem, but this should not be considered a fix and I'm not even sure if it violates the EULA or not so I haven't bothered.  Point is, getting certain covenant rewards is unreasonably tedious for some as a result, myself included.----------------------------These are my major gripes that I think could find broad acceptance.  My minor gripes are FAR MORE IMPORTANT.  Obviously.----------------------------- No bell on a stick and my amazing greathammer 1handed rolling r1 is gone from all greathammers.- No statue on a stick and everyone just circles around the edge of the Pontiff's arena doing nothing.- You can't stand still and turn with a drawn greatbow anymore; the game just interprets this as you getting antsy and takes you out of the draw animation.- I used to be able to play with friends I made in Australia.  Now it is as though we send packets via smoke signals.- NO RUIN SENTINEL SET OR ANY OTHER SET WITH A HELM THAT A HUMAN HEAD COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIT IN.  COME ON, FROMSOFT.  WHERE'S MY GOOFBALL AWESOME GEAR?????I'd still say buy it because I'm an addict and a slave with nothing else to play, and chargeable attacks and weapon arts are the bees' knees.  If you like masochism and hating the thing you love, then the newest Dark Souls is still for you!These are still the developers who, in DS2, had the bewilderingly enormous stones to buff the Chaos Blade on April Fools' Day and leave it that way.Hooray!"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 8, 2016              ||UPDATED FOR THE ASHES OF ARIANDEL DLC RELEASE|| PROS: +Eerily atmospheric and detailed game world.+Fluid attack and movement animations.+One of the best line-up of boss battles in Souls' universe, who now have two phases.+Retains From Software's signature style of lore-building+Complex NPC side-quests.+Haunting soundtrack.+PC Version is fine with little, ignorable problems. (Like FPS drops while connecting/disconnecting controller...yeah) CONS: -Considering the last Souls' games' excellent DLC lineup, DS3's first outing is a little disappointing. Except ONE awesome boss and 6hours to offer, it falls flat.-PvP and Covenant system is a step down from Dark Souls 2.-Weak NG+ content.-Some of the features have been streamlined  , to make newcomers comfortable, which include but not limited to:    Removal of AGILITY stat. Unable to upgrade armor.Forced levelling-up by visiting hub area  POISE!!!!  I don't know what is that. Does it exist? Not anymore.Ability to change covenants anytime, anywhere. You can now move while chugging Estus flasks. While it's neat design in Singleplayer, it's a nightmare to begin with in PvP. - GREAT LEVEL DESIGN! SUPERB! TOP NOTCH! 9/11  While it definitely is better than the linear design of DS2, it's not anywhere close to Dark Souls 1. Somewhere inbetween those two games. VERDICT: You cannot shake the feeling that this game was supposed to be a love-letter of sorts for Dark Souls fans. There is a lot of fanservice and referencing that will intrigue those who spent massive chunks on time on the first game. Inspite of some notable changes, like addition of a focus bar, weapon arts and faster attack animations, this still feels like Souls game. Inspite of somewhat dumbed difficulty and fluctuating brilliance of level designs, I had tons of fun with Dark Souls 3.This is a MUST buy for any fan of the Souls' series or challenging RPGs in general. Definitely a formidable GOTY candidate this year."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 11, 2016              To preface this, I bought and played the japanese version on ps4 to completion already.  I cleared the game 4 times on 3 different character builds, and have invested around 85 hours so far.  This is my opinions based on that.This is honestly my favorite game of all time.  I love the souls series, and with over 1300 hours put into the other 4 games, this has instantly become my favorite of them.  If you take 35% Demon's Souls, 35% Dark Souls, 15% Bloodborne, and 15% Dark Souls 2, then combine them into one, you will get Dark Souls 3.Starting off, what the game takes from Demonâs Souls is the tight, sprawling, atmospheric level design, as well as many other references, callbacks, and influences.  From the original Dark Souls, you have incredible bosses, music, NPCs, visually stunning vistas, and interesting lore.  This game feels more like a sequel to Dark Souls 1 than 2 did, with direct references to the game, as opposed to 2's way of saying that  something happened long ago .  From Bloodborne, take the detailed environments, visually impressive graphics (thanks to a new engine), and a dash of enemy and boss designs.  Finally, from Dark Souls 2, take the massive quality of life changes, that make the game more accessible in a positive way.Pros:+Excellent gameplay, with a combat feel and speed similar to Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls.+Tons of content, with over 150 different weapons, a wide array of armor sets, and solid amount of spells.+Extremely detailed and varied world, with attention to level design and smart world building.  Like Dark Souls 2, the game covers a lot of horizontal distance.  However, the world fits together in a way that makes sense.+The levels are also massive, with some single areas taking up as much space as multiple areas from other games.  There are many paths, shortcuts, and secrets in these giant levels.+Approachable systems, such as a very simple yet deep upgrade system, where weapons can be upgraded to +5 or +10, and infused with a element or scaling path, similar to Dark Souls 2.  However, the paths are much more interesting, such as a strength scaling, quality scaling, luck scaling, and many other paths, in a very Demon's Souls-y way.+The return of exclusively using estus to heal.  No more lifegems or blood vials.  There is a Dark Souls 2 system of upgrading the estus, however you start with 4 charges instead of 1.  Divine blessings still exist but are very rare and you can only carry 1 at a time.+I was personally not disappointed by a single boss, area, or enemy in the game.  There was no drop in quality like Dark Souls 1, lackluster areas like Dark Souls 2, or annoying, tedious grinds, like Bloodborne.  There was a smooth difficulty curve that increased as the quality of the areas and bosses did, all the way to the end of the game.+Mound makers is one of the coolest covenants in a souls game.  The way they work is to leave your white sign, however when you are summoned you are hostile to the host, summoned phantoms, invading phantoms, and enemies.  Your task is to kill a phantom of any kind, so they act as a sort of wild card.  Every encounter I have had with mound makers has been a fun time.+The matchmaking, at least on ps4, has been incredible.  Very similar to the speed of dark souls 2, but with the password system of bloodborne.  Multiplayer with friends is very fast, and can be done immedietely after the tutorial boss.  The pvp also takes a 2 hit combo system from dark souls 2, where it's relatively impossible to get stunlocked to death unless you get ganked.  Backstabs are also a non-issue, unless possibly the other player has a horrible connection.+Amazing soundtrack, one of the best in the series.  So many good songs.However, there are a few problems that some may have with the game:-Magic is pretty hard early game, other than maybe pyromancy.  When trying to play a mage, you have a lot more stats to focus on, and it takes a very deep investment in faith or intelligence for spells to get really strong.  I played a magic character as one of my characters, and I constantly struggled with whether i wanted to upgrade int for better spells/damage, attunement for more mana and spell slots, str/dex to get a better backup weapon, and health since you start with extremely low health.  The cast speed also feels really slow, and you can't cancel casts.  With an increase in aggression, and low health, starting as a spellcaster is very challenging for the first third of the game.  It is doable however, and by the end of the game is very viable and will hit very hard.-Encounters take a very ambush-y and gank-y approach to them.  This is not a bad thing for me personally, but I know a lot of people dislike this method of approach, and there is a lot of it in Dark Souls 3.  With magic being as slow as it is, it makes playing a mage even harder than it already was.-The world is not interconnected like Dark Souls 1 is.  There are no inter-level shortcuts and areas with multiple entrances and exits.  This is a non-issue for me, because the level design was so good that it didn't matter to me.  However, I know that one of the biggest draws for people regarding Dark Souls 1 was how the world was connected.  So this will be a negative for a lot of people.-There is a lack of interesting covenants to take the place of the ratbros or gravelords.  Most of the covenants have a typical function.  Coop, invasions, or protection of a host/area.  This is a let down, as the weirder covenants were some of the more fun covenants that existed.-This is one of my biggest negatives, but also not a big issue in the grand scheme of things.  There are 2 returning covenants in the game that perform the exact same duties.  The blue sentinals from dark souls 2 and the blades of the darkmoon from dark souls 1.  I really do not see the point in having both of these covenants.  The way darkmoons should work is to use the eye orb to invade the world of sinners who invade other players, and let blue sentinels do the guarding of the way of the blue members.  This just feels incredibly lazy, redundant, and a massive oversight into the possibilities of the coolness of the darkmoons.-Probably the most objective negative is with some weapon variety.  A lot of weapons have copy pasted movesets, with only the weapon art to differentiate them, and sometimes not even that.  A lot of weapons are objectively worse than others for this reason.  Boss soul weapons are also disappointingly underwhelming.  However each weapon class is very fun and different, so even if many play the same between weapon classes, there is lots of types to play with.Those cons aside, this game is incredible.  I highly recommend it, whether you are a fan of the series or not.  It takes all the best parts of the other games, mixes it into a nice dish, and adds its own twist to make it stand above the sum of its parts.  I was blown away, and it surpassed my expectations, which were already extremely high.  I hope that the multiplayer lasts a long time, as I will be playing for years to come."

(If you're a fan of berserk then this is definitely the game for you)Do you want a game challenging enough where even the most basic enemies can kill you very quickly if you mess up?If the answer yes then is this the game for you, if not then get gud or get out."

There won't be one day where you don't meet someone spamming, trolling, cheating, hacking, & of course pointing down after they kill you in the most annoying way possible. You might come across some friendly players, but very rarely if at all. Even I find trouble not wanting to be trash because everyone else is to me & shows no respect. It's a cycle of getting trolled all the time, getting mad then turning into one of the cancerous players yourself. As for the game itself I have 2 words. Buy It. I've beaten this game at least 60 times between Xbox One, PS4, & Steam. I have all the achievements for it. You will be put to the test of beating one of the hardest games known to the general gaming community. You will die, over, over, & over again. You will think that it's impossible after being stuck on a boss for 4 hours. I have personally been through hell when I started playing Dark Souls, but in the end it is worth it. It is a amazing game.Even though the community isn't great I still recommend this.You can enjoy the game & the community even if you're a friendly player like myself, just be prepared to have a lot of patience. Otherwise you will end up either quitting the game, or turning into a sh*tty player like everyone else by the time you beat it.Praise The Sun â¼"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 4, 2016              The sequel to Dark Souls 1 that we deserved. I love the series - and so, let's get down to the things I dislike about the game. >>RANT BEGINS<<*Extremely linear in comparison to Dark Souls 1, and extremely short in comparison to Dark Souls 2*I was never a fan of sorcery, or how overpowered it seemed to be in the previous game. For some reason, though, sorcery seems to have been gimped considerably, way more than I'd like. Being an effective sorcerer now requires full commitment with very little in the way of build flexibility or room to explore. You'll still melt most everything in the game - but it will feel significantly less fun.*From seems to have delighted in nerfing Faith to oblivion for a long time now, and this game may just be the worst example yet. As of Patch 1.09, there are actually A COUPLE actual Faith weapons, and offensive miracles are MARGINALLY useful in certain controlled circumstances, now. Before recent patches, it was entirely useless.*Most weapons seem recycled from the previous two games, with not much in the way of new weapons. Though there are plenty of boss weapons, Dark Souls 3 seems to have largely ignored the Dark Souls 2 quality-of-life improvements that made boss weapons actually useful. As it stands, very few of them are even viable. The same can be said for most offensive spells, as well.*The Poise reworking means that heavy armor is now almost meaningless, save for large weapons' hyper-armor. Anything but the lightest of armors feels like a waste.*Although I am not fond of Dark Souls 2 in general, I have to admit that that game went to considerable lengths to make most weapon builds viable. Dark Souls 3 seems to have thrown all of that out of the window. Cookie-cutter builds are sadly all too common as a result, with not a lot of the flexibility, variability and surprise aspect that PvP (and even PvE) had in the second installment.*NPCs seem to have considerably less dialogue this time around.*Covenants are mostly broken and largely meaningless.>>RANT ENDS<<With all that said? Dark Souls 3 is a wonderful game, and feels like a true successor to the original Dark Souls, even if it doesn't quite manage to be as good as the first installment. The controls feel amazing, the enemy and boss design are as strong as ever - if not stronger - and the world and lore are worthy of the name. Weapon Arts add an interesting layer to combat, Focus Bars instead of Spell Casts (as it was in Demon's Souls) increase flexibility. The music -might- just be the best in the series (though that's obviously heavily subjective). NPCs have less dialogue overall, but almost every single one of them has a questline to pursue. In truth, these may not feel like groundbreaking changes from the first game, and really, they aren't. Yet, Dark Souls was never really about innovation for the sake of innovation, but solid design polished to a mirror sheen. And even though Dark Souls 3 has a few flecks of tarnish, it is a fitting and satisfying closing to this beloved, genre-spawning series, and even with it's flaws, it's better than most games out there."

It'll be tough the first time, listen to what the game is telling you to do trust me, this isn't a game that you want to just skip out on the story, plus you'll end up lost a few times if you don't listen, though that might've just been my stupidity. Anyway, would I recommend this game? Yes, for sure, the PvE is fairly good, there have only been a few times I've been killed and got mad at the game for it being BS, but if you take your time, go in carefully, you shouldn't have trouble with any of the enemies in the game, just remember, the size of an enemy doesn't matter, poise is a lie, and prepare to die."

Even though the remaster of the first game has it detractors, it runs wonderfully on both console and PC so please do not let it hold you back. DS3 has many callbacks to the first game, which made it much more enjoyable. This game does not need another positive review, but I'm going to throw my 2 cents in anyways even almost 3 years after release. Boss design is much improved over the first game. The bosses are hard, colorful and much more flashy on screen. Each boss really feels unique with no reskins like the first game (which had 3 demon bosses). I am not that good at these types of games, so I had plenty of time to appreciate each boss :)  The art and environment are stunning and even the normal mobs have great detail. The only place that FROM seemed to have regressed since the first game is level design. It is so much better in the first game. This game, although more visually beautiful has a much more linear design, and the worlds do not feel as connected. Great game, and a great time to play it with Sekiro coming out this March."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 24, 2017              I love this game, but there are a few issues you should know before purchasing. So I guess these will be cons first, then I'll hit up the pros.CONS: My biggest gripe with this game (there is another one, we'll get there) has to be the optimization. There's no settings that drastically affect FPS in any real sort of way, aside from resolution and the more prominant,  oh of course these settings will affect FPS . But those are only one or two settings. Textures, shadows, reflections, all of that jazz can be set to medium/high settings and you won't see any difference in FPS if you usually played on low. This sounds good, yes, but if you're wanting to get rid of that constant 40 FPS in one area, you're not going to have any settings to help increase those frames. And frames are important in this game. The other big gripe I have has to do with the camera. The camera controls have been seemingly downgraded from the past souls games, which I didn't think was entirely possible. Dark Souls 1 had a great lock on system, where you could lock onto an enemy from further away and it KNEW what you were wanting to lock onto. If you were surrounded by enemies in DKS1, changing lock on to a different target was a breeze. But in DKS3, sometimes that changing enemy lock on move just doesn't work. Getting attacked by a giant crab that deals half of your HP while simultaniously being surrounded by tiny crabs that do hardly any? Which do you think lock on SHOULD lock onto? The massive crab or the little one? Apparently it thinks that the little crab is more of a threat, thus ending your character's life with one swift claw strike. Awful!Pro tip: a lot of bigger enemies have SUPER slow wind up attacks. It's hard to predict a lot of the time, but with practice you should counter it well. It can be very annoying to get hit by slow attacks because you expect them to be faster, but it's okay. Onto the pros:I'll keep these short because all the other praise has been said in other reviews. Bosses are fantastic for the most part. Each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad. Each boss has a second (sometimes third) stage which can throw you into a fit of rage, or make you shrug because not that much has changed. But the intensity is fantastic in these stages.The lore in this game takes after the lore from Dark Souls 1. While you don't need to know exactly what you're doing in order to play and have fun, it's suggested that you either buy and beat Dark Souls 1 (and 2, if you want, but nothing significant really happens there, not from what I can remember). Or watch lore videos on youtube, whichever works for you. Either way, the story unravels in item descriptions and they're probably the most entertaining thing to speculate and hear about when you're not actually playing the game. The story is amazing, you just have to think a little.And finally, my favorite thing about this game, is the fact that it took everything that I loved from Dark Souls 1 and made it better while also removing everything I hated about it, too. For example, you shouldn't need to know how to toggle escape from a Chaos Zweihander, you shouldn't hate invasions because of backstab fishers and abusers. I think that's about it for what I have to say. Tl;DR: it's pretty fun, worth the money, buy it. PS: Get the Ringed City DLC first if you don't have enough for both DLC's.PPS: dark souls 3 did invasions right, fight me about it."

        "Comments": "Posted: February 16, 2018              This game is not for the impatient or easily frustrated... That said.OverviewDark Souls III introduces a new a way of approaching fiends and phantoms in combat. This requires (you)the player to learn the ropes of the game through enemies. The movement is fast and unique, and so are the enemy's movements that make it a challenge at first. The Unique sets of weaponry combined with armor, fashioned along with formidable enchantments. This can create awe-inspiring characters that can fend off other players in fear. Otherwise, creating a challenge for other players or the enemies that trying to conquer over. The gist of this only prepares players for the awaiting doom of weaving through a boss's attack and striking back.SceneryThe monumental buildings and cryptic tombs that are surrounded by a torn down world the player travels through. Createing an ominous setting the player can only assume they are in for trouble. The ambient of rooms obscure hidden paths that could not be found without aid from other players. Play Style Although, a weapon with a blade is reccomended the game allows the player to add attribute points towards specific stats. This not only allows the player to use certain items at their potential but it also lets them choose their way of player. These are the main builds I have observed.. (Pyromancy, Miracle, Intellegence, Archers, and Swordsmen). The diversity players can approach an enemy are unique and each weapon has it's unique style of play.StoryThe story revolves around the player(Unkindled), rising from a pile of ash that must seek out the Lords of Cinder to return them to their thrones and assume their souls as a new champion. The player must seek out to restore a successful linking to the  flame .Some important technical Information*The game's aspect ratio can change the brightness to a high an absurd high value.*It's reccomended you get a Nvidia 900 series card or the AMD equivalent with a four core processor.*V-sync is very useful in the game and eliminates tearing issues very well."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 29, 2016              So, having played the other souls games to death, I decided I'd challenge myself and roll up a deprived build. Being the lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I am, I decided that I wasn't going to get any new weapons or armor after I picked a set I liked. Now let me tell you guys.... I was wearing the rags from the uchigatana master, and the sages hat.... I was wielding the starting club, and grass crest shield.I played the game to the best of my ability, and I played the whole thing solo. I was having a ton of fun.The enemies were faster than all the other games, but I could demon souls roll now.... none of their attacks mattered so long as I  Got gud . And gud I was... for I had played the others. Now somewhere in my head I had this crazy idea that no one would think of normally in dks1.  What if I go raw on my club for max physical without ever having to put a point in my str or dex? .  I was thinking in my head, the scaling would be horrible, the damage wouldn't last, I would die before I killed anything.I went on to beat every boss with that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ little raw club, without help from summons, NPC or otherwise. Since I had no need for my souls I dumped them all into health and stamina. My friends and I got the game at the same time, and I was the first to finish. Not only that, when they had complained about certain areas that were built to exploit the weakness of their builds, I had powered through them. When they had mentioned some annoying bosses, I had beat them on my first try.My faith in Miyazaki had carried me through. I learned that through my self imposed suffering that I had found the perfect PVE build. Everything else in the game was put in, with its promises of power if only I would stray from my path.... from my God Miyazaki's teachings. I denied them all and was rewarded.(PS the club isâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥for pvp, don't even bother. I still pwnt people tho b/c they were scrubs.) Once I had completed this journey and basked in the immense euphoria of beating a souls game with a club basically naked. I had something in my inventory.... a certain greatsword from a certain prince with C, D, D, D scaling in the four main stats.I knew what I must do. I pumped every point henceforth into those four stats while still in rags and that overly gigantic hat. I went on to rip entire thirds and fourths off of boss healthbars in new game +.For everyone who gives a bad review because something that was once the right way has been changed, you must change. You must embrace Miyazaki and cast aside your worldly desires for defense, poise, damage, range. You must cast aside your shield, you must cast aside everything that you believe to be a reasonable choice against an army of monsters and use your faith in Miyazaki as a weapon. (And not a faith build, club > lightningbolts.)I have seen the light, and I have been rewarded. You can experience unbridled bliss and joy, by ascending to paradise. When I arrived, it all faded to black as that last ember slowly died. Through the deafening silence, only two words filled my mind. Two words described what had happened. Why I had succeeded and where others had failed. Two words that described my journey. Two words that embodied my faith in Miyazaki. Two words I had lived by since I first played, even kings field and evergrace! TWO WORDS RANG THROUGH MY MIND OVER AND OVER! I had broken down into tears because I had found the answer and stayed true over all these years...And I will tell you what they said to me... Git gud."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 12, 2017              My first experience with Dark Souls III:As this was my first Dark Souls game of the series I haven't played (well... finished) any of the other Dark Souls games. And the reason is simply because Dark Souls II's hitboxes are too broken for me to enjoy it and I don't have a controller to play Dark Souls I. YES that means I finished Dark Souls III with a mouse and keyboard..... But I will tell you this for all the people who are still unsure to buy this because they don't have a controller. Mouse and keyboard works perfectly fine! A controller might be  The best Dark Souls experience  but as a PC gamer I wish to play games on a mouse and keyboard and not be expected to buy a controller to play a certain game. One of the most beautiful things about Dark Souls III is the music. The music is simply stunning! It fits perfectly in every area and it really gets you into the dark atmosphere that surrounds the Kingdom of Lothric. The cutscenes are also very well made and really get you hyped to get into the game to learn more about its dark story. The diologue voice acting is very well done and makes you actually want to listen to what the characters have to say.As for the bad part of the game, since no game is ever perfect. The port from console to PC is kind of horrible.... First of all you have to navigate through the menu using E as enter and Q to go back (DAFUQ?!) and all the controls are displayed as controller buttons. Which is very annoying when you are new to the Dark Souls series and first play through the game. There are tutorial messages but ofcourse they all display the controls with controller buttons aswell... Thanks to this you have to open up the options and look at all the keybindings to see what button is the equivalent of the controller button displayed. But becides all that, once you learn the controls you should get the hang of it fairly quickly and you will get used to it in no time.Right now i'm about halfway through new game plus which some of the borderlands players might recognize as true vault hunter mode (you basicly play through the game again with your same character and you get to keep all your weapons and stats but everything is slightly more difficult) and I am still enjoying every second of it. I see now how some people have spent over 300 hours on this game because it simply never gets boring. YES it will get frustrating at times but you just have to keep going and not give up! It is perfectly fine to take a little break though when you are having trouble with a certain area / boss. As I have done this plenty of times aswell and that really allowed me to keep enjoying the game without getting mad at it too much. If you keep having trouble beating an area or boss you can summon a friendly player to help you out as there are plenty of people out there willing to give you a hand.I know not everyone will agree with my opinions and this certainly won't be the same for everyone. If you are into RPGs, like finding new items and gear and are up for a challenge. I'd say buy it and see for yourself! Don't let the fanboys discourage you or the fact that you might not have a controller. But don't buy the game and then get mad that the controlls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed because it is already very clear that Dark Souls games have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ console ports.Conclusion:Great game, great atmosphere and an amazing dark story. But keep in mind that it is a bad console port and if you are planning to play it with mouse and keyboard you will have to deal with the consequences. I say it is worth a buy but not everyone can enjoy it like I did."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 20, 2017              So, after putting a lot of hours into all of the Dark Souls games ( mostly Dark Souls 1 and 3 ) i decided to write a review about this awesome game! Dark Souls 3 is the third and possibly the last Dark Souls game in the franchise, and frankly, it is a worth end to the series. Now let's talk about some aspects of the game.The Story Ever Since Gwyn has linked the first flame, there were countless other heroes that relinked the first flame so that the age of fire can continue. The three main Lord of Cinders ( SPOILERS : or rather i should say four, if you count Lothric as a Lord of Cinder. I personally don't, because he never actually lit the first flame ) rise from their grave because the fire is threatened. These lads are supposed to re-link the flame so the age can continue, but instead of doing that, they would rather watch the flame die out. So the flame ( or..rather the Bell of Awakening? i don't know ) wakes up the Unkindled. You are one of these unkindled ash. Your job is to bring the Lords of Cinders back to their thrones. Either Alive or as Ashes. My overall opinion of the story is that its pretty awesome, but can be really confusing sometimes..and it needs a lot of reading. Some portion of the story isn't actually there, you have to theorise.The Gameplay Dark Souls 3's gameplay is basically Dark Souls 1's gameplay, but with a lot of fixes and balances ( and some â¥â¥â¥â¥ups xD )You still have the same main stats, but some of them either got removed, or they were made into one stat ( Endurance no longer gives you more equip load. Instead, equip load can be raised by spending points in Vitality.  And also, the Resistance stat from Dark Souls 1 is completely gone, you can't invest points directly into resistance ) Also, because of a lore aspect, you no longer have the option to stack up Humanity. Actually, Humanity is quite gone from this game, instead you use Embers to restore your link to the other worlds and also give you an HP boost which lasts as long as you're alive. ( To Simplify it , once you use an ember you can be invaded, but you can also summon other people to help you at certain areas ) Summons ( also Invaders ) also have the option to use Estus ( although the overall Estus you can use while being summoned is reduced ) Now you can also equip up to four Rings! Quite better than just two rings. Oh and one other thing, Poise is completely broken. Covenants also return, and quite frankly some of them are really fun and they give you good rewards, and some of them are totally dead. For example, The Blade of the Darkmoon ( my favourite covenant from DS1 ) is utterâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in this game, since you can't level up, because the covenant itself relies on another covenant ( Way of Blue ) which is a completely dead covenant on levels above 25 SL. Also in this game, as my good friend Jack would say   Medium Roll actually works  . In DS3 medium roll still has the same Iframes, but now your character recovers much faster at the end of the roll. Overall , the gameplay is pretty cool, you have a lot of variety in Magic Stuff ( Pryomancy, Offensive or Healing Miracles, Sorceries , Dark Sorceries/Miracles/Pryomancies ) and you also have a ton of Melee weapons to use. This makes DS3's replayability INSANE, because you can literally make *ALMOST ANY KIND OF BUILD* you want. Controlls I highly recommend using a controller. 'Nuff Said. I think the controlls are good, but if this is your first Souls experience, you gotta get used to it first. The Graphics, Areas and Armour This game is super gorgerous! It looks amazing in almost every area! I especially love how Irithyl looks like, with all that snow and stuff. Superb! I really like how some weapons got some extra details ( Boss Weapons look amazing! ) The enemies are also very nicely detailed. Almost all of the areas look very cool, but honestly there were some areas that could've been bigger and better detailed. For example, the Profaned Capital is a joke. It's basically a 5 minute run to the boss and that's it. The Armour in Dark Souls 3 is really good! There are a lot of armour from DS1, for example you can get Lautrec's armour..or Artorias's armour ( Sadly Lord Blade Ciaran armour didn't make it into the game ) You can do a lot of cosplay by combining other armour pieces together. Overall they have a lot of variety.Some things i wanted to mention as either cons or pros *SPOILERS*Dark Souls 3 continues DS1's and DS2's trend with having some ridicolously easy bosses. Wolnir, Deacons of the Deep, Crystal Sage and the Anchient Wyern are basically a joke. Dark Souls 3 also continues the other trend from the other games, which is that the main guys you are supposed to defeat are probably one of the easiest bosses. The Abyss Watchers themselves aren't so hard, Yhrom the Giant is a complete joke. Aldrich isn't so particularly hard either. Although thank god the Twin Princes actually manage to put up some kind of challange. I would've enjoyed if most of these bosses put up some kind of challange *SPOILERS ARE OVER*Also, there are the Invaders. I myself don't have a really big problem with invading, but some people really don't like how some of the community handles invading. Some invaders tend to come to you, use gestures and get you to do an Honor Duel, which is cool. Some invaders particularly like hiding behind enemies and gank you while you're trying to defeat the enemies so you can kill the invader. Overall, yeah, the community isn't perfect, but hey, that's not the game's problem. You can easily punish these invaders by using a Seed of a Giant Tree, or you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ with them some other way too.Alright, I think that covers most of what I wanted to say. Let's gather the cons and prosPros :-Fitting end to the Series-Lore is quite interesting-Awesome gameplay mechanics-Good variety of magic or pure melee weapons-INSANE ammount of builds. You can almost make any kind of build you want.-Graphics are awesome-LOT of throwbacks to Dark Souls 1.-Forgot to mention, this game has an amazing soundtrack!-Most of the bosses are really well done gameplay,detail and lore wise.-Can be played as coop game almost entirely.-DLCs are pretty cool ( i'll try to write a review about the DLCs later on )-PVP-Lot of NPC questlinesCons :-*SPOILERS* the main Lord of Cinders were pretty easy to defeat. Yhorm the Giant was pretty dissapointing.-Some areas in the game got very little ammount of detail. The Proned Capital had some potention, but it was completely wasted.-FromSoftware, where is my Ciaran armour??-Poise sucksâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ It's broken. It does not work.-â¥â¥â¥â¥ Covenant farming.-Blade of the Darkmoon is utterâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-The insane ammount of lag in PVP. People can literally hit you with a broken straight sword 3 meters in front of you. I don't know if PVP is designed that way or not, but they definitely should do something about it.Sometimes you land a huge hit, and the enemy easily rolls through it, despite the fact that seemingly you hit the dude in the nuts.Final Verdict : 9/10. If you already have completed Dark Souls 1 ( and loved it ) i definitely recommend you to purchase Dark Souls 3! If you have not yet played any kind of Souls game, its still worth to pick up, but you'll need some time to get used to it. This is an awesome end to this series! I would also like to give a shoutout and a huge thanks to my good old friend Jack for introducing me to the Souls franchise and playing every DS from the beginning to the end, and to REAPER for those cool NG+6 rage momentsThanks for reading, peace out lads!"

(Did not work duh) Deleted my main save that had 4 characters one of which on new game +4 and started a new one.Deleted everything to do with the game off my PC, then reinstalled it all.Changed OS and wipped the whol PC (Nothing to do with DS3 just wanted a fresh start) so literally only thing on my PC that I've installed at the time of writting this, Steam, Google chrome and Dark Souls 3.Also submitted a lot of support tickets, even went to so far as to email a copy of my savefile to FromSoftware.Got no response and now I get on today to find I have been penalized.GG no RE.EDIT: As of today 27/05/2016 the softban has been removed from my account, I wasn't told anything about this matter by support or otherwise. So if you have this ban it seems you just have to wait till they feel like unabnning you. Good Luck.."

I haven't seen any bugs, yeah, I'm pretty sure there is alot of bugs but I haven't seen them. I played this game something like a 100 real hours.. And I can say it woithout a doubt: This is the BEST GAME EVER!Giant, sometimes almost immortal bosses, detailed open world, good lore. It's PvP there and an exellent combat system (better then For Honor's xD). I killed my FIRST boss after 2 hours of pain and suffering, but it was worth it, all that joy after the kill, I just can't convey it in words. I didn't killed a couple bosses, but I enjoed to play this game, it was alot of good time with a friend and some random people, it was a good time... At last I want to advise you to buy this masterpiece. If you have some friend or several friends, so you just MUST buy and play this game at least 20 hours. I want to warn that it's a lot of farm at the game, and don't take mage or pyromancer for the first time because it's too easy..| Enjoy this game just like I did :)"

More forgiving than previous ones but harder to catch up with it because it is faster. +There are many ways to make the game easier for you, from usable items to different builds, magic and weapons.+Good item, armor and weapon variety.+Smart level design, which encourages you to try different things gameplay-wise. It also uses visual story-telling, so most of the things don't look out of place. (unless it is designed to be)+Good enemy variety.+Pretty graphics and animations.o The story is kinda obscure like older games. Which certainly gives it a charm.o It is easy to miss some NPC interactions. But they add replayability.o PVP and Co-op is a little too disconnected to the main game. Covenant rewards are pretty hard to get and not that cool. Some enemies and bosses are too easy with co-op even though some of them react accordingly with more AoE attacks. But they're still features and it's fun to play with people.o The dodge is powerful so it helps with faster builds while making slower builds relatively worse.o Shields are not good.- Dodge is too powerful for the PVP. It is mostly aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥show. It becomes too chaotic and invasions can take forever.- Armor is mostly fashion. Heavy armor only helps with poise(sometimes) and the damage reduction is bad. Especially worse when you could dodge out of the way in the first place. Shields are bad too so some builds are not good anymore. There was some gameplay value in the previous games which is not here anymore.- There are places where the game feels inconsistent. A weak looking enemy not staggering when hit while a big guy can't stand against you. A mob spamming his best move. AI pathfinding freaking out. To be fair the game is about observing the enemy before acting so it does not affect the gameplay horribly.- Some bosses are either too weak and/or don't feel special.- Mouse support is not that good but they tried.This game is not perfect but it is perfect with its flaws. It is aware of itself and does not pretend to be something it is not. The PVP and Co-op are not that good but you have to go out of your way to use them anyway. The armors are bad, but it is not like you can upgrade them like in DS1, they don't make you feel like armor is that important. Those bosses who don't feel special are not really special anyway. They're dudes who happened to be in your way. This game is a complete experience, this game is difficult, it does not hold your hand and it becomes way easier when you figure it out like every game should be. It is never unfair, it is either you or your character not suited for that part of the game. Use your items, upgrade your items and abuse the systems of the game. The game will not feel cheated if you abuse it as it tries to abuse you constantly. Play it at your pace, don't hit your head against the wall, try to go around it. And if you feel like you don't want to find another way, you can still do it your way but it might be way harder. It is okay to be upset if things don't work out, but if you don't like to get upset at times, there won't be any relief when you beat the challenge. So get ready for that.DLC REVIEWS:-Ashes Of Ariandel:  Short but fun. It is worth it but does not cut it when it comes to surprising you. It has 2 nice bosses, but nothing really new. Mostly some generic enemies and a beautiful map. The painting has its own story, but it is not as interesting as the rest of the game because it feels disconnected.-The Ringed City: This DLC would be really good if it was not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t level hard. High HP and DMG enemies all around. One of the bosses (the optional one) is like something from WoW or a JRPG. It takes a while to bring him down as he can pretty much one shot kill you instantly. Other than that, it is pretty cool because it keeps on giving. It surprises you with traps that you have never seen in Souls series before. It shows you bits of unseen lore about the order of the Dark Souls universe. The Dark Souls series end. But these games are never about when you get there anyway. It's always the climb."

        "Comments": "Posted: January 23, 2018              Hello there ! If you're planning to buy the game. I'd like you to please not focus on the negative reviews where people whine and complain about the game, and just give this review a read.   The optimization is terrible ! Don't buy this game !  - So I've started seeing these reviews mostly coming from people who bought the game during the christmas sale. Saying their game crashes, can't run it properly etc. But bro, if thousands of people are having no issues about running the game and YOU are. Don't you think that it is a problem specific to you ? The optimization is the best it has ever been in the Souls series.- Sure it must feel like sh*t, paying so much for the game and having it crash on you, I'm really sorry, but the fact that you're having problems running the game, doesn't make the game  Badly optimized  most people are running it just fine, your specific problem doesn't make the game get labeled as  Badly optimized for pc  You're just driving people away who might have a great time playing the game. I mean I wouldn't buy the game if most reviews said stuff like that. But I wouldn't also know that it was just that specific guy having problems with running the game, having near 10 thousand people running it fine.- It is misleading, everyone should buy the game to see if they can run the game, and if they can't, just refund ! Though many people don't simply do that because they read all these  OH MY GOD TERRIBLE OPTIMIZATION  type of reviews. See my point ? I hope so.  Terrible PC Port ! IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY WITH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE !  (just what the f*ck)- FIRST AND FOREMOST !  It is entirely possible to beat the game with keyboard and mouse, even wreck everyone in pvp. If you want to play with a keyboard and mouse, there is literally a guide on YouTube telling you how to set it up for keyboard and mouse, you just need to change a few key bindings ! You can change them to fit however you like ! - It is just stupid to see people complain about it when there is literally no possible flawless workaround for this game to be just as better in keyboard and mouse !  It is how the combat was designed, this is the best possible solution. Everyone should be thankful we even got it on PC. SINCE IT IS A GAME ORIGINALLY MADE FOR CONSOLES.- The previous game to Dark Souls I that From Software made called  Demon's Souls  was only available in PS3 I believe ? Although they aren't connected in terms of being a series, the mechanics are the same as Dark Souls. It was originally planned for console. Dark Souls I came out LATER to PC. -  But I am still having problems  It is smoother with a controller obviously. Having switched to a controller after hundreds of hours on DS2 and DS3. I can confirm. It is evidently not a PC game, BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO PLAY IT JUST FINE WITH KB MOUSE ! Just don't F'ing whine about it when your experience is not as smooth when you're not playing the game with the intended tool.  Don't play this game for Co-op ! It is bad !  - See, these are the type of people who can't handle defeat. They're the people who get infuriated when their self inflated ego is even minimally damaged when they lose. Because they can't possibly lose ! Even when they play DARK SOULS where you are SUPPOSED TO DIE to learn. The repetitive dying and coming back is literally your role in the story ! Being undead. But no ! They are literally the incarnation of god. If they lose, the game is sh*t. They criticise the games system with their sh*tty arguments caused by their little to no knowledge about how balance in video games are supposed to work. - Okay, these people will say sh*t like:  Oh it is designed to be played solo ! Co op is bad in this game !  etc. If you don't know much about the game, let me explain:The reason they say that, is because you are faced with an extra challenge when you do Co op, which is a matter of BALANCE. Since there is little to no repercussion to summoning a phantom to help you. You need to use numbered items called  Embers  when you use Embers. You become  Embered  You are in the Embered state until you die. What embers do for you, is that they give you a %30 max health boost, and they give you the ability to summon other players as white phantoms to help you throughout your journey. But that's not the only effect of an ember. See, by using an ember, you are accepting other players to your world. Being both white phantoms AND INVADERS. An invader is basically a player who comes into a world, and their objective is to eliminate the host. An invader ONLY comes into your world if you are Embered. The more phantoms you have, you are more likely to be invaded. It is a matter of game balance, since you are literally able to have 1-2 or more guys literally beat the game for you, without you even moving a hair. Which, if people literally are going to fight the enemies for you, protect you from them, help you beat bosses, it would make it easier. People who don't want to get invaded, and want  Uninterrupted Co op with their friends  literally want to have other people walk them through a game that is supposed to be DIFFICULT. By summoning phantoms, you are negating a lot of the difficulty since you can have 2 or more people play the game FOR you.In a game as difficult as Dark Souls, sure you will need help from time to time, it is only natural for humans to seek help when they face difficulties. I'm not saying it's wrong. I am just saying that if you are making the game easier for yourself,  a game that is supposed to be difficult isn't going to let you do that without any consequence. The summary of the system is  If you want to summon help and negate the difficulty, we are going to balance that by adding a bit more difficulty so that it stays DIFFICULT. Because this is Dark Souls. Now to move on to the cause of the  Severe Butthurt  people have. It is simply the invasions. Invaders kill them, they get salty because they take it as a personal attack towards them or some sh*t. (Yes they are THAT dumb)- When you are invaded, especially as a new player, it would be hard to face an invader who probably knows his stuff, you know. Someone who can beat you just because they are better than you, and that might be frustrating. It's easy to understand that.- BUT WHAT IF ? THE GAME LITERALLY HANDED YOU MULTIPLE WAYS TO COUNTER INVADERS ?! When you Ember up, you can summon 2 phantoms. When you get invaded, it is basically a 3v1 against the invader, which on paper is of course UNFAIR. Same as phantoms, invaders also have half the amount of healing items (Estus Flasks) than the host can have. A host can have up to 15 Estus, while an invader or any type of phantom can have a maximum of 7.- In order to win, the invader has to use their cunning and their skills, it is simply stupid when 3 people actively spam attacks to someone when they can only dodge so many, so what invaders do is, they gear up better to face multiple opponents at once and they use the level and the enemies to their advantage. These type of people complain when they can't 3v1 someone. Even when the host has %30 max health advantage, twice the estus, availability to summon either phantoms, or Blue Spirits who come to help you if an invader is in your world. After all that, when they literally get sh*t on by an invader who simply outplayed them. They complain...pitiful. - If an invader won, they were able to outplay multiple people. While the party, being 2-3-4 guys constantly attacking the invader and watching each others backs, have an easier time making mistakes thus the invaders use of wits become a crucial part. You can literally use passwords to summon someone who can even be on maximum level who can have all the good stuff one can have and yet I have to write SO MUCH about this topic in the review.If you are confused, you can add me up, ask away"

Similar in quality to (the first half of) Dark Souls 1, maybe even a bit better now that poise actually works. World layout isn't as good though.The PvP on the other hand...dear lord, it's the worst of the 3 Dark Souls games. By a lot. Flawed in a lot of very frustrating ways. And of course From has literally no idea how to balance weapons, so some weapons and weapon classes are just plain worthless. Nothing new there."

But for some reason the gate has always slam shut and Iâve never really felt the warmth of its disparity. This is the first time I have managed to traverse the kingdoms and give it new hope to become a Lord of Cinder.Throughout the age of video games, there are a few titles that are possible to admire without even having to play them. But sometime you are fascinated by the vivid hints of its concept, the art, the unique experience, overshadowing any flaws it might have. Because Dark Souls have flaws, oh yes! Flaws that would be cut into history as the most strange of decisions.If you have been living in a world of Darkness until now, Dark Soul is a game about never feeling at ease, never being secure, never knowing what will come and always dying at the smallest of mistakes. You traverse this masterpiece of level design, trying to reach the next safe haven of a simple bonfire. At times you may find yourself on the other side of a fog wall, fighting an opponent five times your size, but with twice your speed. But donât be discouraged by those daunting battles. The essence of the game is in the gratification of an impossible victory.The genius nature of the Dark Souls universe, is not telling you anything, giving you snippets of poetry or the ramblings of a knight turned madman, not making any sense. Anyone not dedicating a large quantity of time, will make little sense of the story. But that is ok, because for a vast number of people, trying to interpret the story, puzzling it together, makes the whole community come together as the archeologists and historians of Dark Souls, filling the internet with theories and story-arches. Even if you are not part of this collective, watching the community collaborate, is a awe-inspiring thing.If you are pondering the question of: Should I get into Dark Souls this late? The answer is an overwhelming YES! This is the most polished version so far, all the clunky technical issues of the past have vanished, the bonfires are abundant, the frame drops are a memory and it is most certainly worth dying for."

Your character literally cant die at all so there is no condition for losing. You dont even need to find healing stuff: you will get it very often at lots of checkpoints.Perfect graphics will also attract players who like fancy look'n'feel. A good storyline accompanied with extremely beautiful cutscenes will not let you fall into boredom. Just try any game from Dark Souls series: these games are absolutely funny and they are suitable for relaxation after a hard day.In total: 10/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 20, 2017              Before this review starts, I know I screwed up the Dark Souls II review, so I apologized for that one.Dark Souls III is a RPG game created by From Software and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment (formerly Bandai Namco Games). The game sets in interconnected world of Lothric. The whole throughout of the playthrough, you will find similar area from the predecessors, the enemies, the NPC, weapons and armor for long time Dark Souls fan. The lore is still cryptic as usual and you will find the lore understandable if you know what is going on during cutscenes and dialogs. The game is running with Bloodborne engine, which is a great thing. So, let's talk about the changes in this game.Changes:The changes for Dark Souls III is somewhat accessible. Accessible as in - upgrading armor is removed, so pretty much you can wear whatever you like (Fashion Souls III). Combat system is great, but power stancing from Dark Souls II is gone. The poise, ugh it's completely obsolete, no matter what you wear. Covenant system seems to have a nice change, where you can change at any time without losing the Covenant.Gameplay:Okay, I am going to do a positive side. I am not sure if it is a fixed difficulty where for the first 11 hours, I feel like this game is easy. Fast forward, holyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it can be friggin hard and take 20+ tries to take down the boss. The enemies and bosses do have their own unique attack patterns as usual, so it is not the best to play agressive. I have not played the Sorcerer or Pyromancer yet, but I am assuming they are still powerful but not as overpowered from the predecessors. The item system is improved. The official soundtrack of Dark Souls III, it's a 10 out of 10.  The combat system is extensive, you can change variety of weapons (my favorite weapons so far is Great Scythe and any twinblades). The multiplayer is now better than ever. I can't tell you how much I love the matchmaking options system, where you can put the password so one of your friends don't get summoned by randoms and play offline system. This is the best Dark Souls multiplayer yet. I am done with positive side, now I am going to talk about the negative side. Everytime I beat any boss fight, the bonfire spawns at the boss fight area (how many friggin bonfires are there in total?). I feel like Dark Souls III is being generous to players because it doesn't feel like an actual difficult game from predecessors. I really do understand that people who never played Dark Souls before. I found New Game Plus to be more, easier than playing on your first playthrough. It's disappointing and I wish they could've done something to New Game Plus, like damage modifiers, enemy health pool and usual stuff to make the game difficult. The poise in this game like I said feels nothing to me. The performance issues seems to be minor at times, even hard froze, FPS spikes, that's it. The items in this game can be worthless. The PvP, it's really annoying how people play - as in chasing the invader but getting baited by PvE enemies, the meta can be broken. Newcomers will find it difficult when getting invaded by seasoned players, so it's best to play offline on Matchmaking Options. Forgot to say that the PvP is riddled with cheaters and modders.Verdict:Man, I got to say that I am still sad that I finished the trilogy (need to get the Season Pass to play the Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City). The combat system, lore, bosses and items are great. But performance issues are minor, boss fight area bonfires are unnecessary and poise system is obsolete. This game made me want to come back and sink more hours into the game for builds, PvP and pretty much s h i tposting memes for me (Hail yung maestro). The conclusion was satisfying and I am glad that I finished the Souls series. I will give this game a 9 out of 10, a great solid recommendation for newcomers and veterans alike."

ThereÂ´s something about this game that just amazes me which are the boss battles...they are so immersive i literally yell when iÂ´m fighting them,i feel fear courage and despair and it is so goddamn satisfying,especially when u kill the bosses, u just feel so rewarded. This game was incredibly hard for me,it was really tough to beat it for me and i gave up many times but in the end,at the end of the game,i really felt like i achieved something,something worthy.If u are like me and u have never tried dark souls i highly reccomend it as it is for me an unforgettable memory."

When they hit me with an enchanted dagger, they started changing my soul count to 50,000,000+.   The game then ejected me and banned me due to having 'inconsistent data'.   Due to someone else's hacking, I lost a character I had used 20+ hours of time.   Hackers remain unpunished while legit players become victims.   Unacceptable. Patch notes have absolutely no detail of changes, just some vague statements about things being 'adjusted'.  Also Unacceptable.From Software needs to step up and fix their issues or their amazing game will wind up a disappointment."

        "Comments": "Posted: January 30, 2018              Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic Souls game, and is a great starting point for the series, as it's by far the most accessible in my opinion. Here's why:EnvironmentsThe land of Lothric has wonderfully varied and immersive areas, from stone ruins, to gothic architecture, to vegetated forests, to cloven cliffs and wild geological features. Miyazaki's fixation on the fantastic tales of old Europe and their themes, as well as works from mangaka (or perhaps, work. laughingmiura.jpg), results in a diverse yet cohesive experience. I have minor complaints about a few areas, though it's mostly because or length or lack thereof. EnemiesJust as unique as the world they inhabit, the enemies of Dark Souls 3 vary wildly in looks, fighting style, timing, and weapon types. Some use magic. Some use shields. Some can grab you and kill you almost instantly. Some will pursue you relentlessly. and almost all of them respawn with every bonfire refresh. Although some may be easily outwitted, they counteract with extreme lethality. You can choose either to fight them, or run right by them, but many drop items, including the weapons and armor they wear, so pick your fights wisely.PlaystylesWhat I find truly magnificent about this game, is that you can almost never play it in every possible way. There are literal hundreds of build possibilities, from weapons and shields, to rings and buffs, to spells and staves, to throwables and bows. Your leveling is used to allocate permanent points into health, magic, stamina, weight, strength, and dexterity, many of which are requirements for certain armors, weight loads, weapon types, etc, but many scale with your fighting style, making you stronger and stronger as you level it. Poise, which gave you I-frames while rolling and made you drink estus faster, has been made a flat and invisible stat that everybody has roughly the same. You can be  big man with big sword that smash thing  to  little fast man that backstab  to  Battlemage McSpamarrow  and everything inbetween. You can make joke/theme builds, you can challenge yourself with a meme run, or you can just play it oldschool. The ChallengeThe common misconception with Dark Souls, is that it's just flat-out hard. Though it can certainly be challenging, it's only hard if you can't learn from your mistakes. Dark Souls is unforgiving. It does not hold your hand. If you roll at the wrong time, you get hit. If you get greedy and swing one time too many, you get hit. If you try something random, you just might, you guessed it, get hit. And when you die, you drop your souls right in that spot. This game tests you, and it punishes you for not being able to keep a cool head. It teaches you to play a game of attrition, of patience, of strategic defense and offense. And if you succeed, you're rewarded with the ability to advance in the game, some currency for your troubles, and/or a token or souvenir. Effort is generally rewarded, though there are some ruses thrown about in different places.It's fantastically satisfying to clear heights you thought were previously unreachable, because you evolve as a person. Feeling extra confident? Go invade real people and duel it out. Be the bane of other's people's lives. Triumph over real players, or just get yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥whooped. If that's not for you, and you don't have the time or energy to memorize boss sequences or  git gud , simply summon a friend or phantom. They'll help you along by taking aggro from fights and get some extra damage in.In SummaryDark Souls 3 is a game full of options, with multiplayer tied pretty efficiently to singleplayer, that has pretty good replay value, and is more accessible than some people think. The mechanics, in my opinion, feel a lot more intuitive than DS2, despite how polarizing a statement that may be. Controls are good for either keyboard or controller, graphics are pretty gud, Bosses are exciting, DLCs add extra gameplay and items. It's a thrilling experience, albeit rage-inducing. Oh, and you can make absolute atrocities with the character creator, which is a big highlight to me."

(I struggled a bit with the first boss, and struggled even more in the next area I got sent too)However I ended  up refunding the game.   WHICH WAS THE DUMBEST THING I COULD'VE DONE After the refund I obviously uninstalled the game, but after an hour or so, I wanted  more, alot more As I said earlier, I haven't played any Dark souls games so I can't relate to what they are like however.. The bosses in Dark souls 3 starts out by being mediocre, the hardest part is by far to get to the bosses.halfway through or so the bosses starts to become extremly effin interesting and theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥is difficult, really took a 180 and ramped up like nothing seen before. Especially the Namless one..  Replayability? Tough one, once I finished the game, I ended up hunting a few achievements, then i set sail into NG+ and instead of making a brand new character I respecced my character completely went from being a warrior to a pyromancer, Going from a Warrior to Pyromancer was a major turn aswell, Playing the pyromancer is so different to being a melee character, a completely different way to play.Or simply just beat the game as your starting class or completely switch mid game, completely possible.. The game is so free in that sense, you can do whatever you want.. (well almost) Conclusion?Best game I've ever played, the story was absolutely amazing aswell I rate it  9/10"

Yes, my hours are a wee bit absurd, I'm aware.Anyway, to the review...Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game with plenty of replayability, gorgeous enviroments, fantastic, memorable bosses, awesome level design, cool weapons and armor, and solid PvP, and so forth...If your an RPG fan who doesn't mind a good challenge, then definetly at least highly consider Dark Souls 3. At least on your first playthrough, you will get yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥handed to you a lot of the time but overcoming Dark Souls 3's tricky areas, enemies and bosses is a very rewarding gaming experience, and well worth it. At least solo wise, I would say in it's entirity exploring everything, Dark Souls 3 is a solid 40-50 hours run through for the average players first playthrough. I highly recommend doing your first playthrough solo, it's much more rewarding, and will definetly feel like a longer experience. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is at least 9.5/10 or 95/100 for me. Brilliant game, recommended."

It feels like they took what they learned from all the previous games and made this game the most refined experience out of them all.  It feels streamlined but in a good way, itâs missing the interconnected feeling from Dark Souls 1 where every area connects with each other which I kind of miss but on the other hand I wasnât getting stuck as to where I needed to go next every few hours like I did in Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 3 you always know your path ahead and itâs a good feeling and you can feel the the progression you are making which is nice. Itâs the most atmospheric souls game too, it does a great job immersing you in its amazingly crafted environments. The level design is terrific, a lot of awesome and memorable areas and much less frustrating and annoying ones like the crystal cave in Dark Souls 1 or the shrine of amana in Dark Souls 2, there is nothing close on that level of annoyance in Dark Souls 3.  The combat and movement is the best itâs ever been, I like how its more fast paced which you can tell theyâve taken from Bloodborne and itâs a welcome addition. It was by far the easiest game in the series but I think thatâs mainly because I have a lot of experience from the franchise rather than the game itself being easy because I can see some areas and boss fights being really difficult for newcomers in particular. I think this game is a masterpiece in design and execution. 10/10 (Masterpiece)"

        "Comments": "Posted: September 15, 2016              Now, with my vast experience of every SoulsBorne game, and each of those from the Dark Souls trilogy on at least two platforms, I believe I can offer a well educated judgement of Dark Souls 3. I will be comparing it to its predecessors, naturally, but I shall also judge Dark Souls 3 as a game in its own right.So, for those that haven't played a Souls game before, and won't understand my comparisons. Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game, but don't buy it. Go play the others, at least Dark Souls 1, or I'll come to your house and slap you until you do.Right. For those experienced in souls, and want to know what Dark Souls 3 is like. Prepare to be both amazed and disappointed by this game. Dark Souls 3 keeps the complex combat of the previous games, in face goes one step further by making it so complex that it makes no f***ing sense. Diminishing returns and the peculiar new 'poise' mechanic make ultra-heavy armours mostly useless, as they weigh you down. It's fine for me, because I always had 0 poise, but for those that always killed the 4 Kings by R1 spamming in Havel's.... gone are those days - but chugging is easier. As usual, there's a hell of a lot of weapon variety. Unfortunately, only a few from each class are viable, as many weapons are wholly outclassed by others in their category. The same goes for armour, but nobody cares because fashion is what's important. Despite what some say, magic IS viable in DS3 and actually remains the most powerful thing in the game if used correctly. Hyper Armour is a new addition. Certain weapon types now offer hyper armour during parts of their animations. This is good, since there is a lack of useful poise, but is very easily abused... and so 2-handed Hollowslayer is very powerful against someone who can't parry - not kidding, among the best weapons in the game.The world design is similar-ish to DS2 mixed with Demon's Souls, but the individual area design is more akin to Dark Souls 1. In general, it's bloomin' good, I just wish the world as a whole was more connected. The HUB of the game works a lot like ademon's Souls and Bloodborne. Host to your very own Maiden / Doll for levelling, merchants, a blacksmith, and gathering place for various NPCs... it feels a lot like the Nexus in this regard. It is also disconnected from the main world.The story and lore is just as expansive as its predecessors, and only more theories and secrets are coming to light as time passes. The same goes for a NPC quest lines. They are very akin to those in DS1, boasting unique encounters with NPCs and witnessing their stories unfold as yours does - take Ostrava, Siegmeyer, Solaire and Logan's quests for example. Most quests are as complex in nature, each with their own emotional and compelling story, as well as new kinds of gameplay features to improve upon the quests. Honestly, I think DS3 is host to some of the best NPC quests and characters, on par with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1. Unfortunately, we have no Mephistopheles asking us to kill everyone, but there is one similar quest, and obvious reference.The soundtrack is amazing, on par with that of predecessors, and accompanied by equally awesome bosses. There are slight disappointments, as with all of the games, but the majority are very good. Just be warned, bosses are more aggressive in DS3.Finally, I'll summarise. Dark Souls 3 has its fair share of disappointments, but the are few enough not to tarnish the beauty of the game, and they are almost all mechanic based disappointments that may or may not be altered in later patches. The game, as a whole however, is fantastic and absolutely worth buying. PvP takes getting used to, because of the changes,  it is still good. And some covenants suck, but that's nothing new. However, don't let it deter you from getting yet another FromSoft masterpiece.PS - Also... do buy that PS4 for Bloodborne, because it IS worth it."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 15, 2016              Dark Souls III is everything you wanted from the first Dark Souls, and leaves out what made you dislike Dark Souls II. While I will continue playing this game even after completing it; I wanted to give you guys a proper review.ProsEnvironment is breath taking, and puts the earlier Dark Souls games to shame in comparison.Far more interesting enemies than humans in armor, including bosses.Nostalgia is strong with this game, and you'll love every reference thrown your way.AI improved dramatically, so enemies are going to give you a challenge.Weapon variety is great, which also applies to armor.Armor cannot be upgraded, so wear whatever you want. Fashion souls is back!If you love exploring, this game will consume you. Easy to get lost in.So many shortcuts, secrets, illusionary walls, you'll always stumble on something new.Co-op is easy to access, and hardly any problems with the server.Character creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out.Each weapon has a special ability, making each one unique on it's own.NPCs are really developed, and don't stay in one spot. They're also very likable too.Quests are back, so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events.If you like horror films, this game has some nightmare fuel for yah.Can now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots (hold down on down depad).Replayability is a solid option for sure. You'll most likely have multiple playthroughs.Enemies don't despawn, so you can grind to your heart's content.Your covenant changes the kind of invader you are (sunlight makes you a golden red phantom).Soul Memory is gone, so get as many souls as you want for upgrades / items.Four endings to earn, each offering a strong impact to the story.ConsHeavily influenced by Bloodborne's mechanics, so most enemies are fast & furious.Enemies don't really have a stamina limit, so they can spam their combos for awhile.Lack of spells, hexes, miracles, and pyromancies. They're all cool, but not many to be found.PvP is sluggish, inferior to Dark Soul 2's PvP which was fun and balanced.Certain enemies can't be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks.Game can feel short if you don't take the time to explore any optional areas.Until you reach more than half way into the game, weapons are hard to upgrade.Too many ambushes, which leaves you less surprised when it happens again.Most enemies have higher poise than you, so you're going to be dodging / blocking more often.Game is more demanding with graphics than Dark Souls 2, so you might need to turn certain options on low.Certain areas make the FPS drop, or lag so be ready for that.Tends to crash now and again, depending on what you're doing.Covenants are weak, and not satisfying to rank up in.Invasions / invading isn't fun because again PvP is sluggish, wonky and poorly done.NPCs can die easily from anything, so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation.Ember is hard to find, but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission.NPC enemies / invaders deal more damage, have more HP & poise than you. Unfair.Can lose the chance on getting items / armor if particular quests failed.Greatswords and weapons alike are either weak or OP, there is no middle ground.Game rewards you for being aggressive & spamming over thinking carefully like previous games.Luck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning.ConclusionIs Dark Souls III worth getting? YES. It's an excellent game and despite there's a lot of issues I have here and there with it, they did an excellent job making this game spectacular. NPCs are engaging & very interesting, bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs, almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful, co-op is very enjoyable to be a part of, scenery & the setting is absolutely beautiful (even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye), and each build is going to be fun to experiment with. Granted, it's a shame that the game wants you to play it like you're in Bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile & fast for their own good, but otherwise this game is a solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. Worth full price, plus we haven't even gotten the DLC yet! Hope you guys were able to get most out of my review, and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game!"

        "Comments": "Posted: October 12, 2016              Prepare to die all over againâin FromSoftwareâs final installment to the genre-defining epic conclusion to one of the most challenging and memorable video game franchises of the decade.In a game where messages on the ground tell you to whack your sword at stone walls, jump off of cliffs, invaders rudely stepping into your world with the sole intent to spill your guts, and where every bossâs theme sounds like a final boss theme, itâs easy to get lost in the wonderful world of Dark Souls.You know a video game series is getting somewhere when other games released after it are compared to the âoriginalâ. Take for example, the original DOOM from 1993, many shooters that came out after DOOMâs release, were labelled âDOOM clonesâ, later these games came to known as First-Person Shooters. When Minecraft received international popularity in 2011 upon its release, many games that were centered around block placing and breaking, and item crafting were labelled âMinecraft copiesâ, today they are known as Sandbox games. A relatively new released game, Salt and Sanctuary, has been compared to Dark Souls in terms of difficulty, and is often referred to as a â2D take on Dark Soulsâ, and as of recently many indie games have been released and centered upon death, and difficulty, with a heavy emphasis on bosses, games that were most likely inspired by the Souls franchise.Don't confuse Dark Souls III with your average RPG, it's much more difficult than most can handle, and it's certainly not for the faint of heart. I've seen many people, from YouTube, on message boards, etc. stay away from the Dark Souls franchise simply because of how hard it is. Don't jump into the game expecting it to be a land full of rainbows and butterflies; because it's not. If you're not willing to get better at the game, you won't survive, it's as simple as that.Dark Souls III manages to stand out from the crowd of modern video games, with its central theme of difficulty, demanding respect from its players, and brutally punishing those who refuse to give it that respect, something many video games are afraid to try. The game features minimal hand-holding, as the most âhelpâ youâll get from the developers about its mechanics is the tutorial area, which all it really does is tell you the basic controls, afterwards, players will need to do the rest of the learning process themselves; forcing its players to think, study their opponentâs move sets, time attacks precisely, and learn from their mistakes in an unrelenting arduous journey of trial and error. The game really separates those who are weak and easily broken, and those who are willing to persevere and make it through. Forget overpowered, forget one hitting bosses, forget bum rushing, there is ZERO spoon feeding. You either learn from your mistakes, or leave in a raging fit of defeat.Since death is so heavily emphasized, it basically impossible, for new Souls players to go through an entire playthrough without dying once, (the main menu theme speaks volumes as to how much youâll die). The game was made to be difficult so players can learn from their past attempts. Each time the player dies, you come back stronger, not by stats, but psychologically. By gathering information about your opponent on your first encounter, the game expects you to apply the knowledge in your next attempt. If you die again, learn from that and try again; itâs basically like that movie Edge of Tomorrow, every death only makes you stronger. Because of the gameâs difficulty, it ends up being the most satisfying gameplay experience no other game could ever deliver. Despite dying to that boss at least 20 times, you still managed to beat it, and boy does it feel oh-so good. You know why? Because you earned that victory, despite all those deaths, you learned from past mistakes, and applied it, and when you see those beautiful golden letters âHeir of Fire Destroyedâ appear on the screen, you canât help but give yourself a pat on the back, yell out in triumph, or just breathe out a huge sigh of relief, because you did that, and you earned that victory.Here are some quick details to help you better grasp if the game is right for you:Pros- Fast and fluid gameplay. (Something reminiscent of Bloodborne)- Amazing and unforgettable bosses (save for a select few).- Immersive and atmospheric environments.- Souls veterans will be greeted with much fan service, since the game features several call-backs from the first two games.- Features multiplayer coop for those into PvE, and PvP for the competitive types.- Something I found really neat, was the addition of password matchmaking. It basically allows exact matchmaking with anyone with same password as you, which is perfect for just playing a game with your buddies. Similar to the Name-engraved ring from Dark Souls II. Not only that, but it also removes any sort of restriction you'd otherwise recieve in normal matchmaking, so if you're Lvl 210, you can still connect with your lvl 15 friend who just got the game.- Expansive variety of weapons, armor and spells.- Epic boss music.- Excellent voice acting.- Masterful indirect story telling.- NPC Questlines.- Players will be put in a world knee-deep with lore, assuming players are willing to occasionally take the time to read item descriptions.- Fair balanced difficultyâ99% of deaths in PvE are because of player error; either you didnât time your hit at the right time, you got greedy, or chose to heal at the wrong time, either way, itâs YOUR mistake that led to your death. The other 1% is the rare occurrence of some kind of glitch, which I honestly have never experienced.- Expert enemy placementâplayers should be wary of grabbing items on the ground that otherwise look like a trap, you may be ambushed from the left, right, or even above you.- Your choices matter, a lot, every NPC death, interaction, or anytime you ignore an NPC can dramatically alter questlines, affect the outcome of the game, affect your vendor availability, and even lead to missing many key items and materialsCons- Non-existence of Poise, an attribute that players from previous games should be familiar with, and another thing the game is notorious for lacking.- Storyline can be easily missed if players donât take the time to read item descriptions, or pay attention to character dialogue.- Something relatively minor; 90% of characterâs mouths donât move when you talk to them, which really isnât a big deal, but if youâre the attentive type, it might bother you.- Game as of currently is polluted with a community of hackers, some good, some bad, and the gameâs not-so-great Anti-Cheat has led to the banning of several legit players. If you want to avoid that just play offline through the in-game system settings, and stray away from anything that modifies your gameâs .exe or using CE (Cheat Engine).- For returning Souls veterans, Armor cannot be upgraded in this game, only weapons, catalysts, bows, etc. In addition, the previous upgrade cap of +15 from the first game has been reduced to +10.- While the map isnât 100% linear, map design is still lackluster when compared the first game.With its array of exquisite music, large variety of weapons, armor and spells that cater to all kinds of playstyles, beautifully terrifying and memorable bosses, and breathtaking immersive environments, make this game one of the best modern games released to date, a fitting end to an amazing franchise, and a worthy contender for Game of the Year."

It just takes time to understand the mechanics. If you cannot kill a boss, do not abandon the playthrough and just try once more! Eventually, may be not today but tomorrow, you will defeat it! I cannot describe you the feeling of victory, you need to experience it yourself!"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 22, 2017              Compared to the first Dark Souls game, DS3 is  young and good-looking  with a slightly shallow background story, so well-prepared veterans may find this sequel more like an adventure game instead of a souls game. But any wording saying this game is not a masterpiece is a lie. Dark Souls III is hard than Dark Souls II, but much easier than the original Dark Souls game. Unlike the original game's connecting-as-a-whole map, some of DS3's maps are separated  and only teleport can access, with Firelink shrine being the most typic one. That's a disappointment, since the surprise of opening a door to find a super shortcut is gone. However, I believe that the Dev. put all their efforts in designing bosses and builidngs. Irithyll (still don't get its pronounciation) and Anor Londo are straightly perfect. Sometimes I even feel that the city has the ability to grab my soul, then throw it into an oil painting. Well when my friend was playing this game for the first time, on the stairs between Dancer and Vordt, I told him,  Do you wanna feel Dark Souls ? Then turn left and kill the man sitting on a chair. You'll see.  No doubt he was ripped by Dancer, but he then knew what makes a pretty boss fight. Being the last game of the series, Dark Souls III answered lots of questions and also suggested us endings of some NPCs, no matter you are wondering or not. One is the laddersmith being dead in profond city, right next to the bonfire, who also appeared in Dark Souls II. This story tells us, 15,000 souls for a ladder is too much. Greed will cost your life. Also, is Gywnevere (or Gywndolin) related to Aldrich ? Is Andre related to Gywn ? The fire keeper, is she really blind (even after you gave her the eyes) ? Why is Patches  Unbreakable  ? I was super into lores of DS for a while and some of those questions really bothered me. There are Youtube channels making videos stating their own opinions. Check them !      The pros+Bosses are more agile and harder (My circus needs a dancer. Anybody ? )+ Lots of endings (Yes and for achievements you have to proceed to NG++)+ Best DLC of the series + Beautiful weapons and magics + Princesses are always gay (?)The cons- Battle mechanism stays the same, especially for mages. - Too many bonfires (lowers the difficulty)- Dislikable blue bar -Where's my Dark Souls III The Fire Fades Edition ????  (Now I know that only PS4 gets it. What a pity.)-Why is there an Anri ? I need Solaire."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 17, 2017              In 2011, my journey began. And in 2017, that journey ended. The original Dark Souls (2011) kindled a relationship with a video game that I had never experienced before. That relationship is stronger than ever, having morphed and strengthened over time across the seriesâ three iterations. The first game caught my attention, enthralling me in an imaginary universe I had never experienced before, but also tested my metal. The second game continued on the first gameâs strengths, but never captivated me like DS1. And now we have the third.In all honesty, I had my reservations about the latest, and final Souls game. Before the gameâs release I felt that From Software, the developer of the Soulbourne series, had exhausted their creativity and originality with the first and second games, and thus the third would end up a mere imitation of the series previous outings. But alas, my cynicism was proven wrong. Spoilers aside, this third outing in the series sees players take control of the âAshen Oneâ, a being tasked with bringing a bunch of âLords of Cinderâ to task, thus ending, or beginning anew, the age of fire â a daunting task, as in DS1 & DS2, you yourself became a Lord of Cinder at each gameâs conclusion. The game functions and plays exactly as the previous two games. âIf the formula aint broke, then no point trying to fix it!â Over +-35 hours you will explore a wide array of environments, defeat enemies, collect souls, consume said souls, and kit out your character with increasingly more powerful items, outfits and weapons, so that you can go and explore more dangerous locales,  defeat even bigger enemies and consume more plentiful souls. This formula is repetitive, but maintains the playerâs attention through continuously presenting him/her with increasingly more challenging encounters that require skill, learning, knowledge and, for me at least, pure dumb luck.For some, the Souls games may prove difficult, but I believe the better term is âchallengingâ. Once you have learned the ins and outs of the gameâs combat and rpg mechanics you should be good to go. Of the three souls games DS3 does a good job of presenting the player with challenging encounters that never enter the realm of feeling impossible. The only boss that disproves this is Midir, an optional DLC encounter who functions much like other bosses, but has a ridiculous amount of health that can take what feels like eons to whittle down. Moreover, the challenges the bosses present are, arguably, made easier by offering the player options to summon npc characters to help fight most of the games many bosses. On the other hand, your journey is complicated by numerous invasions, whereby npc characters will invade your world and try their damndest to end your life. However, the AI of these invaders leaves a lot to be desired. Most can be easily defeated by stepping backwards after the invader attacks, then darting back in to deliver some damage; rinse and repeat and youâll destroy any invader. Overall, the choreographed invasions are pretty poor in comparison to what would occur in previous Souls games. Boss fights are the highlight of this game, and they rise to the high expectations set by both DS1 and DS2. DS3 provides a plethora of diverse bosses that range from humanoid warriors to hulking behemoth tree-giants. Each have their own style and atmosphere that never come too close to seeming akin to each other. A major boon for DS3 is that every boss has at least two different phases which force players to often alter their strategy mid-fight in order to compensate for a new phase of attacks or even environment. However, DS3 is quite conservative with regards to the kind of bosses it presents to the player. DS3 does not provide anything close to the alien and strange creatures that can be found in DS1 or Bloodborne; rather most bosses stick to having a humanoid form whilst wielding a large sword- or club-like weapon.To fight these big badass bosses, one needs good equipment. DS3 does a great job at providing a magnificent array of armor sets, weapons and spells. Importantly, the game plays on the nostalgia factor by providing items from past souls games. At one point I was able to kit out my character almost exactly as once done in DS1, as well as DS2. One complaint that I do have with regards to weapons is that the game has a tendency to force the straight and great sword options on the player due to them being so common, prevalent and effective. Both DLCs added much variety to the weapons arsenal, as well as special attacks that can be quite mesmerizing on first sight. Moreover, if arcane warfare is your thing, then DS3 has it covered. Faith, pyromancy and mage builds are supported by a multitude of spells for each school of magic, and are devastating in both PvE and PvP. An integral component of the Souls games is exploration. The DS3 adventure occurs across many well designed environments, each having their very own particular atmosphere and context-specific encounters. From dark dungeons to sky-high castles, putrefying swamps to forgotten caverns, the games does a great job at proving a wide array of areas to explore. Apart from the challenging enemy encounters, the player will interact with several npc characters, some of which will help you out, while others will attempt to hinder your progress. These npcâs are far more expressive than those in previous Souls iterations, with many doing more than just standing around looking glum as in past Souls games. Some of these encounters reveal lengthy questlines, that once completed, have major influence on the overall main story line as well as on a variety of events. This is a welcome advent to the Souls series.Leading from this, we have the lore of the game. Like previous Souls games, little of the gameâs overarching narrative is told through direct story telling methods. Rather, the bulk of interesting and enigmatic lore and story comes from item descriptions and thorough inspection and observations within the game world. By just paying extra attention to oneâs surroundings, major plot points and supporting content can be uncovered. For those gamers that prefer story flung into their faces through lengthy cut scenes and detailed in-game codexâs, be aware! DS3, as well as all other Souls games, takes a more active rather than passive approach to storytelling.With regards to presentation, DS3 is a beautiful game that successfully brings life to a dark fantasy world. Characters models are well designed and textures are good enough to seem realistic. However, some areas lack the intricate details afforded to others, making for an uneven experience from region to region. Adding to the aesthetic of the game, is the music and sound. DS3 sticks much to what has been done in past Souls games. Adventuring across the gameâs world is mostly done in absence of any music score. This and the environmental noise and sound do well to capture the feelings of isolation, loss and entropy. Once a major encounter begins then only does the typical Souls score commence.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic entry and end to the Souls series. It may not experiment or adjust the Souls formula as much as some may have hoped for, but it does present a daunting adventure that will challenge anyone willing to take the chance. Personally, I find Dark Souls 3 to be a great Souls game; not quite as good as its older brother Dark Souls 1, or even its demented cousin Bloodborne. But it is a damn fine game in its own right.Score: 9/10"

Despite this, I would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is. The soundtrack is beautiful, each enemy has its own moveset, strengths, and weaknesses. Bosses are even harder versions of the enemies but don't let the bosses fool you, the normal enemies are just as tough. I've died more to enemies before the boss than the bosses themselves. I've beaten this game about 20 times now with a new build each time. That should give you some insight on the replayability. When it comes to mulitplayer it boils down to two things, you either get ganked the moment you spawn in by three players, or you  git gud  and kill them. Usually you don't get a straight up 1v1 fight, when you do it is glorious, but most of the time you are getting ganked. The reason behind this is the game has a dedicated community, but isn't really growing. Dark Souls multiplayer is great, in my opinion, being able to fight alongside or against randoms is awesome but yet there is only around 7-10k people playing this game on the WEEKENDS. This is a game that came out 2 years ago? So often during invasions you will have to wait 5-10 mins for a fight only to get ganked. Its a vicious cycle. Graphically its beautiful, simple, not top of the line graphics but good enough to make you appreciate it. The weapons and armor designs are beautiful and mostly practical with a few whacky armor and weapons for those who like ridiculous proportions. Lookin at you STR builds >_> All and all, buy, play, git gud. Dark Souls is intimidating for some but trust me, by your 2nd-3rd playthrough you will be beating the bosses in your sleep. 10/10 game."

The last two weeks I have been enjoying the immense world of Dark Souls 2, and I'm now thoroughly enjoying this game.I'm late to the party, but boy am I enjoying it. I wrote my Dark Souls 2 review 10 hours into the game, admitting I was hooked. The same goes for Dark Souls 3, it's an epic game with an unreal amount of content, challenging combat, fun boss fights and lots of exploration and progression mechanics. The game requires an attention span and patience, so it's definitely not recommended for plebs. I said this on my DS2 review and I'm writing it for this DS3 review, this game is welcoming to casual and hardcore gamers alike - although I reiterate, patience is required. Encountering the tutorial boss fight was frustrating even though I absolutely creamed DS2 within two weeks, but it's a great entry into the worlds combat. DS3 combat is more challenging, I feel as though DS2 is more forgiving and a tad less... What's the word... Intense? Regardless, this Dark Souls series is a blessing and I'm kicking myself for not having played it sooner. It's apparent that the developers have put a lot of time, heart and soul into this game and this is something to be admired. The sheer level of detail is mindblowing, and inspiring as someone who is interested in code/software."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 17, 2016              Love it! Dark Souls 1 was my favorite, only due to the dark feel and story.  While I enjoyed Dark Souls 2, my biggest complaint was that it never felt like it had any direction, or purpose to follow. Dark Souls 3 fixed that issue, while going back to Dark Souls 1's dark gothic atmosphere. While also bringing in so much awesomeness into the combat system, with the new stances and weapon arts, the game requires a lot more planning to break enemy shields and blocks, and PvP feels more indepth.  Dark Souls 3, is easily my favorite of the 3 games. However, I will say that if you're coming to Dark Souls 3 for the PvP, and expecting a change in the latency, you will be disappointed. There are still huge delays when being invaded and having to fight someone. Another thing which bothers me, while not a major thing, is if you summon someone into your world for help, you WILL be invaded shortly after, which kind of sucks when all you're trying to do is kill a boss or something, the good thing is often you are 2v1, and can easily dispatch the invader.Either way, I give the game a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the latency issues were addressed.If you enjoyed ANY of the previous Dark Souls, you WILL love this one."

(My achievements say otherwise) This frustrating, cheap, challenging masterpiece, is one of my recent favorites. Iâm sad I didnât get into the series sooner. The first 40 hours or so of this game was hard for me. Since I never played a Souls game before; I didnât know how to approach combat nor how to manage my Estus. I died, a lot. However; once I got halfway through the game, I âgot gudâ as they say. Now almost to NG+ Iâm excited to try the game all over again. :DMy love for this series and DS3 itself will forever hold a place is my heart. PSThe Nameless King and The Abyss Watchers are my favorite Boss fights."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 10, 2018              This is my first souls-borne game, and it has been a weird ride. I did not buy it in the Humble Monthly, but I convinced a bunch of friends to buy it then and join me. 3 of them havent beaten the first boss, one is about midway through, and the other has beaten the final boss. It was interesting to see my friends rage, and that alone made purchasing Dork Souls 3 worth it. However, you are getting so much more than that.The Gameplay is fast paced and rewarding (most of the time). I never died more than 2-3 times in a place, maybe its because I R1 spammed my way through my first play through. Builds in DS3 can be simple or complex, some strategies will work and some wont. In my first ng+ run when I went for the Usurper Ending, I respecced into making a Miracle Class, then a Sorcerer Class, then a Pyromancer. Each playstyle is different and unique enough to where you can have hours goofing off and blowing upâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥with magic. There is a definite learning curve here, but once you get a grip on it 95% of the deaths you recieve are fair game.The Online Aspect leaves something to be desired. Invasions can happen at the worse times, but invading always seems to end up in a world against the Host of Embers and 2 Sunbros which can be a nuisance. Another gripe with invading is that sometimes it takes forever, and joining a game after 10 minutes of waiting can easily get you booted back to your world if the host bum rushes the boss fight in the area. There are also serious latency problems with people using a bowl of potatoes as a wifi hotspot and they start warping around and hitting you from miles away. Another gripe is that Blades of the Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels can only get their covenant items by being summoned randomly into a  Way of the Blue's world when he gets invaded. It never seems to happen, making two VERY nice items almost not unlockable. Summoning friends sometimes doesn't work out, even if you are the host of embers and someone from Idaho in the middle of a war camp joins you, the HOST will get hit reg problems on the AI enemies. Cheating doesn't seem to be too big a problem, but 2 or three times I have run into people who just swing you around with the power of Cheat Engine.The Covenants are garbage. Its basically a grindfest for the little covenant items to get moderately good gear, some of which is required for the achievements. It is 10 of the covenant reward item for the basic rewards, then another 20 for the final reward making it a total of 30 invasions/defend sessions per covenant. Thats where a good 40 of my hours went, sitting around the Pontiff Sulyvahn bonfire waiting for a Way of the Blue to get invaded or to invade someone without 3 sunbros and 2 Darkmoons ganking me.The Bosses are memorable and a fantastic challenge. They act as checkpoints to make sure you have what it takes to procceed. Some of them would randomly grab you when you were nowhere near and just slam yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥into hell, and sometimes they hit you but it doesn't register. The only boss I consider to need a nerf is Darkeater Midir from the Ringed City DLC. Even with fully maxed out weapons and soul amounts I grinded for hours for, this dude tanked hits like an asteroid. I've tried Base Run, NG+, and NG++, only finishing him off by cheesing him with sorceries in my third playthrough for a spell. I think thats the only time I truly gotâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in Dark Souls, so a fair warning.The Level Design is very atmospheric and well crafted. I know the levels like the back of my hand, and where items are located for NG+ runs. You do occasionally run into weird level loading problems where you see textures blockier than Minecraft, but maybe thats just my computer. The enemies in each level are themed nicely, and there is plenty to explore and find.The Soundtrack and Boss Themes are Hype Inducing. Pummeling bosses to memorable soundtracks like the Dancer's and Souls's really makes beating each boss memorable. Everything about the sound design is top notch, except whenever the playable character makes a noise whether its an emote, one of those weird stones, or taking damage. These noises are slightly jarring, and really take me out of the immersion, its probably a me thing though.The DLC purchased together is a fantastic deal and a good amount of content, however if you purchased Ashes of Ariandel alone you really arent getting much for the 15 USD. Ringed City however, is easily worth the 15 Dollars. Both DLC feature new bosses, new levels, new items, and overall just more fun to be had.The Lore is confusing. You either need to really get into it and watch videos explaining every detail, or just briefly skim through cool looking item's descriptions. What I did understand was good, and if I ever decide to play other Souls-Borne Games, I will invest a lot more into learning the story. If this is your thing, theres a lot here to dig your talons into.Performance Is Not The Best At Times, but if you can run the game maxed out at a stable framerate you really have an eye candy. I cannot do this however, and at medium settings I drop frames heavily in the begining of Archdragons Peak and the Dreg Heap. There is a bit of crashing whenever you whip the camera around to hard, especially during boss battles / summons / fricken Archdragons Peak.The Community is a Mixed Bag. You get the R1 Spammes with dark gear, and then you get the helpful people on reddit comparing weapon stats and bowing. Its interesting.The Price I would say is fair, but getting the game on sale with the season pass at 30 dollars USD is a steal. Better yet, if you didn't buy DS3 for 12 Dollars with Ashes along with a slew of other games something is wrong with you. I personally paid the 40 dollars for DS3 w/ DLC, and it is most certainly worth it. In Conclusion, Dark Souls 3 is a game I put too much time into just to get all the achievements so I can feel justified writing a review. Pick this game up on sale definitely, a good 8/10.dark eater midir is bs"

It has the - awesome -  feel of Demon's Souls and its hub, the lore and the parry system of Dark Souls, some of the improvements (you're not forced to go NG+) and the lenght of Dark Souls 2 and, finally, more characterized weapons and a slightly more fast paced combat system from Bloodborne. I would say the same on the level design, with a central hub and many huge areas connected between them. Slightly more linear than Dark Souls but larger than Bloodborne and waaay more complex than Dark Souls 2: wherever you go there are plenty of secrets and treasures, without considering the amount of creatures, NPCs and missable quest.It's the perfect conclusion to a great saga. I hope Namco will not milk it.P.S.Now, my beloved From Software, can you please make me a new Armored Core/Tenchu? possibly on Steam? :DP.P.SIn the comments there was concerns about the lenght of the game so:The first playtrought last around 40-60 hours, after that you can easiliy speedrun it like all the Souls.You can also respec your character for free and don't proceed to NG+, so it's easy to test builds!!"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 27, 2016               Greatest hits  album of Souls series and Bloodborne. Instead of creating something new, this game uses a lot of locations / ideas / NPCs / enemies from other games in one bundle.PVE might have been the best in the series, if not for the lack of poise. The fact is that a meagle rat can interrupt you. You get staggered after a single hit by anything.The combat is still great, if you play as a light weight dodger with fast weapon. If only players had some poise. Enemies DO have it, after all. The system is in the game.Enemies themselves are cloned in several locations. It's a little bit annoying to see enemies from the first two locations well past the big chunk of the game, but with new  look  and lore, pretending to be new enemies without any connection to their counterparts from earlier. There's still a good variety and they differ in their behavior and form.Location design is fantastic! They look great and designed well, with good looping for shortcuts (the game does suffer from  does not open from this side  disease though) and enemy placements. And they're bigger than locations from previous games. You would often look from the high place and see a lot of places you have visited or would visit. Simply gorgeous. It would seem at first that the world is interconnected like it was in Dark Souls, but, sadly, this is not the case. The game is very linear with very few branching paths to different locations.And one of the hidden locations is a relighted version of one from the main course of the game. There's not a single unique enemy in it, the boss is one of the previous ones with added aggression. And they put there unexplained fanservice items which do not fit in with the lore. The location looks and feels great, but it's still a damned reskin.Bosses. It's hard for me to judge their difficulty, each boss feels good, that's for sure. Two of the bossfights might go in the top ten boss fights out of all FromSoft games for their sheer feel. And this game contains the best last boss.PVP might have been the best in the series. It did so many things right this time around. So many things... But it suffers from the same problem as PVE - lack of poise. Every weapon stunlock. Meta is to spam R1 into oblivion. Parries are harder and much more punishing for mistiming. Which is good, but that also means you can't parry spammers and the first hit stunlocks you so you get hit two-three times always. Aside from overpowered Caestus (it allows to parry like in Dark Souls (on reaction) and has incredibly fast recovery animation, which let's you roll away from attack even if you missed a parry) and they brought a system from Dark Souls II where you can't parry heavy weapons (running and rolling attacks excluded). So they really hit a nice spot with parrying in this game. Time to nerf caestus recovery animation (i.e. - prolong it).They also  fixed  backstabs. It has a starting animation now, like in DSII, but in DSII even with this animation backstabs were often glitchy and unfair. In this game out of hundreds PVP matches I was backstabbed once and it was my fault (got greedy on attacking one player and his buddy caught me mid animation), while I backstabbed countless parry spammers (besides caestus - recovery from parry is not immediate and with a bit of prediction of a parry you can easily punish players for spamming).Back to weapons. Light weapons are a meta, since stun-locking and fast attack speed. Are heavy weapons dead? Not entirely.They brought back an amazing system from Demon's Souls called  hyper armor . When you swing a heavy weapon, at some point in the swing (differs for different weapons) hyper armor activates and you can no longer be staggered out of animation. So you still get hit, but your attack is not interrupted and you can hit your opponent as well. It's incredible. The problem is - hyper armor does not start immediately, so you can still be thrown out of heavy attack by a poke from a dagger while wearing full Havel's. It's still much easier to win with light weapons. The only way you can die from heavy weapons is if you make a mistake. They reduced stamina consumption for rolls, so it's really not that hard to dodge forever. In the end heavy weapons are a gimmick and with them you're hindered against good players by quite a lot. Still winnable though.Just a small note - range. There's almost no phantom range! Unless you have a bad connection to your opponent - you can have a hitbox porn where weapon only hits you by the length of it's actual model. No bs with double range for pokes like in DSII, which ruined PVP for me there. Now it's always depends on connection. And most of the time connection is good.Invasions. FromSoft really wants weak players not to suffer? But why? There's already such thing as  offline  for those who dread being invaded.If you're running by yourself - embered, don't summon anyone and don't use a dried finger - high chances you won't get invaded at all (two covenant areas are exceptions). Until you  touch  online by summoning - you're mostly safe. So invaders mostly invade co-opers and gankers. Which puts them in quite a pickle. It's still doable 1 vs. 2 or even 1 vs. 3 (this games allows up to six players in one session. With max three white summons), but if you get to a tryhard gank - your chances are slim.Phantoms (whites, reds, blues, purples, whatever) get half amount of estus flasks they have while being in their world. There are no other replenishing healing items. You can have a single divine blessing of siegbrau on yourself and that's it (all spares go to the botomless box). So From finally did it right with healing items both for PVE and PVP. You also get back one Estus flask for every enemy phantom killed (so for red this means if anyone at all dies, since reds are not allied with each other). Semi-same system in PVE, where you get a flask after some number of mobs killed.In the end it's a great title. But it's a rehash of the previous games, so I don't feel it's possible to rank it very high. It's above Dark Souls II, that's for sure, but is it above Dark Souls and Demon's Souls? No. At least not for the returning player. Because we have already seen everything in it before playing. It was done good before and this game failed to improve ideas, only to copy them."

The game isn't as hard as you think. And trust me, when you find yourself in the intricate dance that is one of the boss fights, you just might find your heart pounding as you roll through the bosses attacks and counter with one of your own. It is a rush that few games can make you feel.The gameplay is fast and tight. Mistakes can be made, but you will pay for each and every one of them. The world, scenery and music are the most beautiful in the series. More than once you will find yourself gazing at an incredible view. The bosses and enemies are well designed and a joy to fight. The story stands on its own, but it also has quite a few callbacks to the earlier games. I can only think of nice things to say about this game. It is a well designed, albeit sometimes frustrating game, with a world and gameplay that few other games can match. Do yourself a favor and try it sometime."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 6, 2016              Hi. I 100% finished the game. Here are my thoughts. +Game seems more challenging than DS2. Normal mobs seem tougher than the Covetous Demon, Dragon Rider, the Last Giant and many of DS2 bosses combined. +Soul Memory is gone. Back to DS1-style matchmaking+Not locked to 30 FPS. Cough, DS1, Cough.+Connecting to others/playing with friends is even easier than before. Password system works wonders.+There are many feature/quality-of-life improvements. There are too many to list them here. +Keyboard/Mouse control works great. I never liked using controllers. Are you reading this, DS1?-New Game+ and beyond rewards nothing new in terms of enemy placements. Enemies are slightly stronger (hardly noticeable) but otherwise, the new playthrough is exactly same as NG. Rings are only slightly better. Except Gold Serpent Ring +2. It's amazing, -Terrible frame drop when loading new areas. If your computer isn't Lord Skynet, the game will force you back into the main menu for low FPS. You'll need to restart the game to continue online. -If you have just enough stats to wield a weapon in two hands, your status page will not display the true AR chart. Mildly annoying. -It takes ages for you to be summoned as a Blade of the Darkmoon or as a Watchdog of Farron. You'll end up doing a lot (like literal days of farming without lengthy online sessions) of farming/grind just to max these covenants out. (If you're interested in getting all achievements)-You can tank (partial parry) a hit and immediately continue to parry again. A single reposte will usually kill you because everyone online is a Hornet Ring wearing, twinking asshats. -Online player character models sometimes just don't load, becoming completely invisible (but can be locked on). -Sometimes, enemy character model won't even have an animation. Leading to hilarious/frustrating duel. -There's no Guard Break mechanic from DS2. It takes multiple kicks to break a Greatshield. A smart greatshield user won't let you kick multiple times. -40% of invaders are Estoc R1 spammers. The other 40% is impregnable greatshield users. The 10% is Iron Flesh/Sacred Flame glitch users who insta-gib, defenseless people. The last 10% are the noobs that need to git gud. In summary, Iron Pineapple is the bane of all things nice in DS3. -Poise still doesn't work like you want it to. Instead, hyper armor is granted to heavier weapons when swinging. Heavy armors will take heavy stat investment with questionable returns. That's all I can think of at the moment. TL;DR version:+It's better than DS1 and DS2. +It's easy to play with friends. -Frame drops. If your PC sucks, then you're gonna have a bad time. -Online PVP will kill you little on the inside, unless you're a PVP veteran from previous Soul games."

        "Comments": "Posted: February 26, 2018              Dark Souls 3 Is a magnificent game, just as all the other projects Miyazaki has been a part of. No Dark Souls game has disappointed me in the past, much the opposite actually, so of course my hopes were high when I first played this game. Long story short, no matter how high my hopes were, this game was able to surpass most of them.Dark Souls 3 decides to go back to It's root story telling, like in Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1. The game starts you off with a short premise, a short explanation, targets you need to defeat, and then throws you off in the world. Also going back to It's roots is the magnificent level design. Like always the areas in Dark Souls are all inertwined, rewarding the player for exploring around. Shortcuts that take you hours back, making everything more accessible and forcing you to memorize the areas so seamlessly. This way of universe building really enriches the gameplay experience and Dark Souls 3 without a doubt, delivers In that regard. A couple new classes have been added, and some removed, even bringing back the Pyromancer class, which I very much approve of. The humanity system Is a little different this time around. No Humanity or Human Effigy's but now you must use Embers. Embers will, just as the humanities, grant you the ability to summon/be invaded. Your max HP does not suffer small penalties from each death as It does in Dark Souls 2 but when an Ember is used, your max HP bar grows massively, as well as healing you, as It did in Dark Souls 1, but unlike Dark Souls 1, you may not consume an Ember after already using one. The humanity counter is long gone. (Good)In other words the Embers are the junction of all the good parts about the previous instalment`s  humanities . Which i very much approve of. Another notable difference are a couple new stats to upgrade. The most notorious; Luck. Luck does what you'd expect, It boosts your Luck, as a rusted coin would, but permanently. It's good for item drops. The covenants this time around also work much differently than the other games, and in my opinion for the better. In Dark Souls 3 you'll find around the world insignias for covenants, and you may at any given time, equipt which insignia you'd like. Each one of them of course, having their own benefit or draw back, regarding the type of playthrough you'd like to do. Some insignias are very easy to find, others almost impossible on your own without a walkthrough or someone telling you about their existence. Talking about walkthroughs, Dark Souls 3 continues the magical tradition of completely destroying you over and over and over and over. The combat system In Dark Souls 3 Is by far my favorite out of the others. It's much faster and the varietly is so much it can actually get a little overwhelming. This game introduces the weapon arts. Each weapon in this game has a special attack, which will take a little from you mana bar. (Also this game now uses a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mana bar which can be restored using a different type of estus. You'll have to balance your estus usage depending on the type of build you're making. The estus for you mana are taken from your max quantity of estus you have. This max number goes up just like in Dark Souls 2 when finding Estus Shards and returning to firelink. They did not go back to the kindle system of Dark Souls 1, so God Bless)The main Hub in Dark Souls 3 is very cool, It's not even close to be as good as Majula but It for sure has it's charm. The music is super relaxing and most of the time you just can't wait to get back and explore around the area. It would always feel great going back and finding a new npc there, or even some items that I didn't see before, even transfer boss souls, etc. But In all honestly it gets a little morbid later on, making it lose its relaxation feel, depending on how you play the game, of course.Oh and speaking of boss souls, unlike the other instalments, you may now transfer boss souls into weapons, shields, spells, miracles and rings from one of the lords of cinder, that stays in the main hub. Which Is a major convenienceBut that's actually the thing I DON'T LIKE about this game;IT'STOOEASYAlthough very excited when I finally was able to beat the game, I was also very â¥â¥â¥â¥ing surprised by how fast I was able to beat it. I remember that the first time around playing Dark Souls 1 and 2 they took me around a week or two to complete just one playthrough, ending up to be around 60-70 hours of gameplay. I beat Dark Souls 3 In a couple days, ending up with roughly 30 hours of gameplay. All the bosses in this game, on the most part (LOOKING AT YOU WYVERN), are extremely well made, and very relentless, easily one of the best parts about it. But I never felt the same feeling I would always get while playing Dark Souls 1 and 2, the feeling of  oooohâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥no no not right now what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? this is impossible!!?!?! . Usually when playing Dark Souls 3, you just can't wait for the next boss fight cause you just want to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥up, and yeah that's a great feeling, but the whole feeling of dread and knowing that you're not nearly as strong as you think you are, and that anything can just come and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up at any moment the other games gave me really gave true meaning to those playthroughs. The feeling of overcoming such difficulties in the previous games where much more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ic.To compensate a little, the enemies is this game are usually a lot more relentless then the other instalments, even sometimes being a little frustrating, as If their stamina was infinite. All these enemies are dealed with easily If you thrive to attack them with the same aggresiveness that they have, other than staying on the defensive. Another MAJOR issue I had with this game was bonfire placement. There are literally bonfires that are less than 10 seconds apart from each other. I remember finding that very â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid. Also a lot of fan service Is made in this game. The players that are more fond of the first Dark Souls game will most certainely be very much pleased with how the game plays. Areas from the first game come back, familiar faces and armour, many easter eggs and even weapons. To add in on the weapons, Dark Souls 3 decided to continue the dual wielding from Dark Souls 2 but makes It a little easier with putting both weapons for one slot. There are tons of weapons like this so you can go crazy. They also brought back the torch but actually made it as a weapon so instead of using the flaming butterflies and relying on that stupid time limit, just equip it as a weapon and you're more than ready to go. A great improvement. Poison also goes back to it's roots, not drying your whole HP bar  in miliseconds like in Dark Souls 2. No more life gems. And they also decided to do the Dark Souls 2 bonfire mechanic of just lighting them up serve as a checkpoint instead of having to rest at one like in Dark Souls 1, which i appreciate. To end It up, Dark Souls 3 Is an amazing game. Lovers of the previous games will adore the adventure 100% guaranteed. Newcomers to the series, this game will for sure be a great starting point, for its the easiest, most beautiful, less cryptic, of the 3, and I love it!9/10lol jk theres no poise0/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 30, 2016              I enjoyed the game and played through it once.  It has a lot of callbacks to prior Souls games.  At first it seemed like a big improvement over DS2, homage to DS1.  Playing through it until the end revealed a lot of gameplay issues and lots of bugs.  For bugs, there's the ice-skating effect when you summon people online, you even see people's ghosts do this.  That is, there's no animations played, they just move/slide around.  I'd assume this would complicate PvP quite a bit, which I don't partake in personally.  There's numerous issues summoning phantoms, where you try to summon only to have it fail after a short or long while.  There's an issue where once you summon phantoms for a boss behind a fog wall, they will not be able to join, leaving them to have to leave the game and you to re-summon them if you die.For gameplay issues, there's issues with poise not working at all on you.  Getting staggered by rats in full armor where you cannot stagger other enemies that are wearing nothing.  There's numerous skills/abilities/spells used by enemies that go through walls.  There's the ability to kite things back to doorways and cheap kill them since they won't go through.  There's various other one-off bugs and gameplay issues as well that are fairly numerous at this point.  The gameplay issues will most likely never be remedied, the bugs...well maybe eventually but on to my next point.As of writing this review, regulation version 1.06 which was to be deployed on 4/28/16 is still not deployed on the servers, and there's no word as to when it will be.  There's also a hacker using a hacked weapon to soft-ban people preventing them from enjoying the online experience and thus ruining their game, and preventing a refund since it's most likely been over 2 hours/2 weeks from point of purchase.  I guess Namco/From deciding to use their own anti-cheat software which is the culprit in this, which is not working as intended.  Again, Namco/From do not seem to care at this point.  It is probably for the best that this is the last in the Dark Souls series, as the series has attracted the lowest common denominator, becoming a mirror for the world it has created."

This game has done something for me that barely any other game has been capable of doing: making me feel genuinely powerful emotions. This is a game about life and death. If you, like me back in April 2016 on my Xbox, had never played a Souls game before, you'll learn very quickly that death is a frequent occurance. But this game is still  fair . Something that Hidetaka Miyazaki (genius who was the director of DS1 and DS3) said in an interview that has stuck with me is that he doesn't see the game as difficult, but moreso challenging. This way of thinking really changed the way I see games no, and now it's hard for me to go back to other games because of the challenge and sense of accomplishment gained from overcoming a challenge in this game. And that's where the the emotions come into the picture. The intense feelings that I have gotten while fighting (Boss spoilers)  the Nameless King  is something I haven't felt in a boss fight or a fight in any game really. I died so repeatedly while fighting this boss and when I finally slew the bane of mine and many other player's existances [spoilers] (completely optional boss too) [/spoiler] I realized that my hands were shaking, my breaths were fast and shallow, and I was sweating. That 7+ minutes fight made me truly appreciate how amazing this game is. Around this point, which is very late game, is when I really got into the lore of the game, buying Dark Souls 2: SOTFS, and I'm going to pick up the remaster of the original for more stability than the original. This game got me into now one of my favourite series in gaming, as I'm a sucker for good stories and depp lore, this game's world really enthralled me. All in all, this has been such an incredible journey for me, about 2 years down the line, from console to PC to a new Chosen Ash. This game will always have a special place in my heart, and I hope it can do the same for you. This game is so deep and complex it can make some of the most incredible things happen, things that you will remember for years. The way the combat is weighty and slow but still fast-paced and exhilarating is the perfect way to make thrilling gameplay that always has you on the edge of your seat, deciding whether to press on and risk death or to head back to the bonfire to spend your hard-earned souls. This game is phenomenal, and something that I believe is a masterpiece of indirect storytelling, RPG mechanics akin to D&D, and gameplay that makes you feel like you truly accomplished something meaningful. I would recommend this game and the DLC (get them together though, they work so much better together than separate) any day, at full price. This game is amazing."

As for combat, FROM has learned and taken the more responsive combat from 2 and improved upon that, making this the best technical experience in the series.  With months of support post-launch and a new DLC coming out next month, this is a finely tuned experience that is more than worthy of the Dark Souls franchise."

As a player with several thousand hours between Demons souls, Dark souls on PS3 and PC, Dark souls 2 on PS3 aswell as on pc, Dark souls 2: SotFS on pc, and Bloodborne on PS4, I feel I am obligated to write this. For the record, this review will change if the current state of the game improves, but as it stands, the game is not worth buying. While yes, it is a souls game, it is in a poor state. I'll first start by saying that I never played the japanese version, even though it released almost 3 weeks early there. That of course would allow for some sense of reassurance that many of the major issues with networking and balancing would be sorted out by the time of full release. Unfortunately, that's not the case. When the game fully released, the first area of the game after getting to the main hub was in essense broken. For whatever reason, the game made it almost impossible for a lot of people to see summon signs of friends while using the password system. The system that is supposed to make sure that those summon signs were the only ones visible to you and your friends. However, without a password, tons of signs were easily visible. Even if they were useless in the sense that 70% of summon attempts would simply fail and say  unable to summon phantom . So, 3 weeks early and the networking for the first area doesn't even work properly. Alright, moving on to the next area, summon signs without passwords still refused to work on a regular basis, and STILL DO at the time of my writing this. However, passworded signs would show up. This brings me to the next glaring issue, there are multiple covenants in the game that are dependant on automatically being summoned for an area to defend it or to defend a player who is already invaded. These covenants were next to useless when the game released as they would never send you to defend the area associated with your covenant. Thus making it that much harder to aquire the covenants items required to rank up to aquire certain spells and rings that are necessary for the acheivements. Unless you want to farm trash mobs for an hour+ to get your covenants drops. That's right, FromSoft was kind enough to add a method of grinding for the covenants that negates even needing to use them. Seems to me they knew that their networking was so broken that they made sure to add an offline method of doing covenants. Before anyone says,  Well they put it there so people can play offline and still do all the covenants and such.  I doubt that someone so concerned with collecting all the items and such would play offline. Another interesting thing, is that the armor stat  Poise  (it's in armor pieces stat pages, on the character stat page and there's a ring dedicated to boosting poise) is turned off in the config files for players. However, NPC's still have it. It essentially makes actual defense stats more important than anything. Unless you use certain heavy weapons that have infinite poise while using a light attack. It makes trading with heavy weapons an impossibility if you're playing PvP as hitting them before their attack connects does not stun them and leaves you completely open for a full hit, which WILL stun you and give them a free second hit before you're able to roll away. And again, before anyone says  git gud , keep in mind I typically keep my builds lightweight and even use the carthus bloodring to improve my i-frames while dodging. Not being able to interrupt someone simply because their weapon is bigger and happens to give them hyper armor while swinging puts myself at a major disadvantage regardless of any factors. What else... Oh, the mind numbing difficulty of the game... I'm kidding of course. As far as souls games go, Dark souls 3, is objectively the easiest and most forgiving. Not only are most of the larger, tougher enemies either stun lockable with the help of a phantom, but the larger ones can be viceral attacked after connecting a few hits on them, usually killing them. Also, the difference between New Game and NG+ is negligable. I've completely the game 4 times already, both NG and NG+ and have been horribly dissappointed with NG+. The enemies are hardly any tougher, as you're character is already fully geared by the time you get there and just getting more powerful. Not to mention the signature addition of random dark spirit invaders and red phantom versions of normal enemies that would appear in NG+ in previous games, all the way back to Demons Souls. It's not a new concept, and it kept NG+ fresh and exciting. The ONLY thing to look forward to in NG+ over NG in Dark souls 3 is +1 versions of rings. And I've heard that the only thing in NG++ is +2 rings. It's a massive disappointment for more hardcore players like myself that liked the added challenge of turning a corner and running into a skeleton or hollow on steroids that hits twice as hard. It takes a lot of the hardcore  YOU WILL DIE  mentality that's been a trademark for souls games away and instead changed it to  YOU WILL FARM . I suppose another small thing to note is that large portions of the game feel highly unpolished and rushed. Some areas are breathtakingly beautiful, while others are full of large portions of texture and mesh completely missing, leading to literal holes in the world. Not to mention the weird graphical errors people get where everything goes wire mesh and turns bright shades of purple and green. Or players body texture clipping through armor when you hold a specific type of weapon as a specific gender. Or the fact that on full release, bonfires were one of the most dangerous things in the game, as they would cause a graphics driver kernel crash if you're lighting setting in the options menu was set to anything above low. A real kick in the ribs to players with high end pc's capable of running the game at max settings but being forced to tweak on setting to avoid crashes. Or the fact that after shutting down the game and restarting it, the game had a tendancy to reset the lighting setting to the recommended, detected setting without your knowing, causing crashes that you thought you'd fixed. Another thing of note, is that the game runs like trash on console. It does not play at an acceptable framerate on PS4 compared to pc. Looking at one, then the other, the difference is almost physically sickening. As stated above, this is my personal opinion, and this review is subject to being edited if the game sees improvement. I wish I could recommend it, but I simply can't, and it pains me to say that. I hope you found something useful or helpful in my review before making a purchase. Have a nice day."

However, there's a chance you'll get banned from online play for no reason because From Software and their buggy servers think you have  invalid game data . After they warn you to stop using your save you still get the warning and banned even if you delete your save and start over. A cruel joke.EDIT: To answer your questions, the best cause for the ban I can figure is that I played offline for a bit when steam went down then went back online with a save file that probably didnt match their records."

I'm playing the game on an R9 380, 12 GB of RAM, Win7 x64 and an ancient AMD Phenom II 955. It's on lowest detail at 1680x1050, but the game runs at a pretty solid 25-35 fps. There's some parts that play at 10-15 fps but overall it's very good considering my CPU is the equivalent of a potato nowadays, and according to the sytem specs I shouldn't even be able to run it. I've also had zero crashes as of yet, and I've played it since release so I've been playing on version 1.03."

Great Anti-cheat guys, So good that it even gets those pesky players who don't cheat.Update : I have recently been cleared of this anti-cheating flag and can resume playing the game.However the story is not the same for everyone, and I have since lost interest in the game due to being afraid to play at all if it would result in a soft-ban, barring me from the part of the game I enjoy most. The base game is fantastic with a few balance issues and optimization issues that I would normally recommend to people. However there is a lingering fear that should you continue playing this game online that you will someday be flagged or worse, soft banned while playing legitimately and until that is no longer an issue I will keep this a negative review."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 3, 2016              Dark Souls lll:Oh where do i start? As of writing the review i have 171 deaths and have completed the game 5 times to be precise. (Because i am one who writes everything important or stupid down). Now im going to state a few things i found DS3 to be (good and bad) at.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Start: I find the tutorial area to be much more user friendly than DS1. DS2's tutorial area was much like an arena and had a nice feeling when u were doing it. In DS1 there wasn't really a tutorial area at all. They threw u right into the fray even with the small tutorial writings. DS3's tutorial area feels much easier than the first game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Combat (PVE): While the combat is satisfying when u manage to land a parry and get a riposte. I feel like the AI got slower from the last game. The hitboxes are perfectly in sync and i have never managed to miss a swing at close range on my own world that is. Other than that the PVE is excellent and manages to **** you up at every opportunity you give it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Difficulty (and Controls): In my opinion the game feels alot easier than the first and second game. Everything is much easier to do now. Now u can perform certain actions like parrying by clicking CTRL in the corner of your keyboard. And jumping is now easier. All u have to do is hold the SPACEBAR and press it again quickly when u want to jump. In DS2 u had to hold the SPACEBAR and sprint while clicking the SCROLL button and SPACEBAR at the same time. (Like seriously who came up with that?) and i do know that u can change the keybindings for the keyboard in the menu. U can not change it for the controller however if u decide to connect one to your computer that is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Combat (PVP): Just like in the beginning of my review i will say. Where do i start? The absurdly weird and extremely long ranges on some weapons makes me wanna puke in PVP. Yes sadly as far as i know. Every single weapon has reach longer than the weapon itself in PVP. Secondly everyone who invades will get to use estus. Yes ESTUS the one drink who we all love and hate at the same time has returned to the invaders hands. In DS1 invaders had estus and they could drink it but u could easily punish players who heal often. In DS2 invaders had no estus to drink and had to heal using other means (spells or blessings). Also in DS1 and DS2 u had to stand still to drink estus which made it easy to punish. In DS3 u don't stop when drinking but your movement gets down to crawl for a moment but it's easy to drink when out of range even with the weird weapon ranges. One thing they've done right was make it so anyone who invades or gets summoned always have HALF of their estus and not max. And one last thing players who invade or are summoned will always scale to your SOUL level if your SOUL level is below theirs. So be prepared to atleast invest a few points into Vitality so u can atleast survive a hit in PVP on higher levels. Weapons also scale to the host's maximum upgraded weapon. So keep that in mind.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Rating: 9 / 10 The game was alot of fun. Especially if u can get a friend to play with you. Now to anyone that plans on buying this game for the first time. Prepare to smash keyboards. Alot. Im sure that by the end of this game u will have replaced atleast one or two keyboards if it is your first time playing a SOULS game. Also just give up if u feel like getting frustrated. Walk away and take a break, 30 minutes atleast and then come back to try again. First time i played DS1 i broke several keyboards and at the start of DS2 i was still mildly annoyed. At the beginning of DS3 i came back into a series that i had bad experiences with and remained calmed. Because what i learned from the first and second game was that patience is most rewarding for those who wait.Now should u get the game? If your answer is YES then prepare for JOLLY CO-OPERATION. If your answer is NO then i have nothing to say to that actually and respect your decision.Also thanks alot to  This â¥â¥â¥â¥er  who helped me translate since apparently i ******* **** at english. Give that guy like (dislike) for his nice work."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 10, 2016              ===== Updated June 9, 2017 =====To follow up to some of the remarks and update on review: with last dlc and patch about half a year ago it seems like support for this game has come to the end. With Dark Souls: REMASTERED out I can recommend playing that one instead of this, since it got (in my opinion) much more solid mechanics in terms of design, even though in terms of functioning they may be not ideal (notorious lagstabs that are not as unfair as people would think, there is long explanation but it's for Remasterd review).Dark Souls 3 is certainly still a decent single player/co-op experience, but sadly in terms of gameplay it's an inferior game to past 2 (and now Remastered). PvP experience is still better in other entries. Perhaps if one day FROM decides to remaster DS3 and add back some of the cut content, as well as revert poise to how it used to work in past games, when that happens it will be indeed a superb experience on par with past 2 games. Untill then it's a subpar  just more dark souls, kinda  game.As for build diversity - weapons being worse or better is good for an RPG. But some weapons being drastically better to the point of making whole weapon classes redundant/obsoleteis not healthy balance.As for meta builds - sure you can play with almost any build through game, but as soon as you hit PvP you will have certainly much worse experience than you could running objectively better build.But even then you wouldn't really want to run a build with heavy armor since it doesn't provide you much but requires lots of investment. From being generally and pretty universally useful in past titles, Poise (which is found on heavier armor types) transformed into highly situational and niche stat that demands to be played around instead of supplimenting the way *you* choose to play. In past titles having more poise was a really appealing option, and there was meaningful choise - you could sacrifice some damage for poise and it would pay off since it's universally useful for about any kind of build (maybe except full on glass cannons/builds that are built around never ever getting hit). In DS3 poise only works on particular moves during those moves and generally is restricted to massive-heavy part of weapons spectrum. To make use of it you would have to build your playstyle around forcing hyper armor trades with your opponent, and any decently smart player simply won't trade with heavy armored UGS opponent, because it's obvious who will come out on top should they attempt trading blows. It's just really poor design.===== This review was last updated on July 6, 2016 =====This game could be one of the best Dark Souls games. Really it could. But there are some things that are done way worse than they were even in the least loved by DkS community DkS2.I've tried to do my best at condencing this review and updating it.Weapon movesets. After DkS2 you would expect to see cool, diverse and unique weapon movesets. Wrong! Welcome to next-gen DkS game, where all weapon classes have 2 movesets at best for all the weapons. Boss Soul weapons? Nope, same boring and sometimes even bad movesets. Same goes for weapon AR values: most weapons can be just infused for quality and use that way, that leads to another problem - complete lack of build and weapon diversity.One could argue that  there are different builds! . Yes there are mage builds for example. Could just as well cound fashion souls build too, or cosplays! Majority of players pick quality build, and for a good reason - it is the most effective and universal one. Ofc there are caster builds or dex/str builds but they are much more rare and compared to quality - simply suboptimal.Weapon arts - while some are OKish. some are just disgustingly bad. Scythe weapon art in particular - about same windup as fully charged heavy attack, but way less damage and requires FP. Landing  headshot  adds a little more damage, but it still does way less than charged heavy, having same windup and readability. Greatswords have same weapon art as straight swords mostly (so ye, same weapon art for 2 weapon types). I would any day pick DkS2 parry on Greatsword L2 over the awful weapon art.Weapons balance - a lot of weapons are just plain better than others. Same goes for some weapon classes. Ofc it is souls game so you can play with any weapon and win, but why play with sword  A  over sword  B  if latter is only different from the other in stat scaling and has completely identical moveset?Poise. There was a lot of drama about it, but I will keep it short. As of right now poise is extremely situational, and one could say that wearing heavy armor is heavily punished in this game by making player sacrifice stat point into completely useless otherwise Vitality (that requires ridiculous investment compared to previous games). Fact that some NPC enemyes have properly working poise only serves as more salt on injury. Poise in DkS2 was working almost perfect after all the tuning done, and now we have this.A big step back from previous game in itemization. In past games you could get all weapons or armor you could see in game, with extremely few exceptions. In DkS3 there are quite a  number of unobtainable armors and weapons you will never get, some of them were just cut and are still present in game data.Absolutely same NG+ and on. One of few things DkS2 did right was NG+. It added not just dull  more hp, more damage  difficulty, but also new enemy placement and harder boss fight mechanics. Here it's just +X rings that you can loot.Covenants feel really shallow and oversimplified. There are 2 covenants that autoinvade to kill players, and if you forget about phantom color and  currency  name they are essentially exactly same. 2 Blue covenants that are almost exactly the same except a gimmick difference which doesn't really make much difference (oh, and blue eye orbs gone, so prepare to enjoy sitting for hours waiting to get summoned). Red and purple covenants are pretty much the same as well if they invade with minor difference of purples having a bit more options on how to complete invasion.Regional matchmaking - absolutely useless. On PC game has 2 regions - Japan and not-Japan. So pretty much all this matchmaking does is filtering out Japaneese players (which is actually yet to be confirmed) if you happen to have it on. Other than that - Australian players will get matched with European players or NA players just as likely as players that are actually are in the same region.Patchnotes quality - average patchnotes for DkS3 look like this:  We did some tweaking to Axes, changed Swords a bit, and did some other stuff we do. Also some adjustments were made to Rapiers. Go ahead and guess what we actually did. Overall I'm really disappointed in how DkS3 turned out to be, sure it is great single player(ish) experience for 1 time, but it betrays what Dark Souls was in so many ways by completely discoraging invasions (because in majority of invasions you will be facing 2 or 3 or even 4 man ganks) and should you die you will also leave your souls on the spot you got killed as invader! There are no arenas, no interesting tech in PvP, really boring weapons and bland armor, and rather weak underlying game mechanics.My advice: if you want Dark Souls PvP - play Dark Souls 2: SotFS. If you want to experience another chapter of Dark Souls - sure, this game sure does deliver at least on that, but once you're done with it - you're done with game. It is so unlike previous games in longevity, but it is what it is.My rating for this game as Dark Souls fan is:As another chapter of world story/lore - 8/10As a Souls series game with multiplayer - 2/10I would recommend waiting for FROM to finally decide what they want to do with game and fix at least some of these issues and buy it once it will come with all DLC and some GOTY version. Untill then - Dark Souls 2 is better Souls game."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 7, 2016              EDIT 4/19/2017:  Dark Souls III has received a lot of patches, and had two DLC drops since my original review was written, and I just want to say that having clocked a few hundred hours in the game, my recommendation stands strong.  I had loads of fun with PvP, ultimately, and found that that any gap in balance could be overcome with grit and determination.  They've brought poise into the game as a hyper armor mechanic that is only active during certain frames, an interesting change, and not necessarily a step in either direction, but one that shows they are open to community feed back, and really eager to make a game we can all enjoy. The game still has some pretty harsh balancing issues, don't get me wrong, but there is so much to love. The PvE experience is god damn incredible.  A lot of my favorite souls bosses are found in this installment, the areas are gorgeous, and I just generally enjoyed the hell out of this game.  The lore is interesting, and I grew to love the PvP, even with its balancing issues.  And the secrets hidden throughout it! My first time discovering Archdragon Peak, fighting Darkeater Midir, and so many other things, will always stick with me.  If you have the opportunity to play this game, and have any love for Action RPGs at all, take it and give it a chance. (Original Review Below)TL;DR: Dark Souls III is a great game definitely worth playing, but not perfect.  I'm a long-term Souls fan, so I'm a bit passionate about this, and my negative comments should definitely be taken with a grain of salt, as they're fairly specific (and from a place of love).Dark Souls III has by far the most beautiful visuals in the series, in the same wonderfully dark theming Souls games always have, the same fantastic gameplay beloved in the other installments of the Souls series, and adds another massive time sink for Souls fans needing a fix to sink their teeth into.And it has some incredibly enjoyable lore! I really loved the story elements in this one.  Not only that, it has some of the best cinematic moments in the series, by far.  The addition of weapon arts really gives this game its own unique signature in the series, although power stancing has, sadly, been removed.   This game is much more of a direct sequel to Dark Souls I, and plays off of it in many ways, so those who didn't like the changes in Dark Souls II will be more comforted in this installment.Now for my brief rant on what let me downThese are by no means deal breakers, but with how much I love this series, I'd be remiss not to mention what felt like steps backwards.  It's fairly well publicised that poise is just gone in this game.  Not altered, like Dark Souls II, completely removed.  Basically every weapon will stun for two hits in PvP (unless it's some broken combo) and stun endlessly on most enemies in PvE.  The combat as a whole has been just a tad simplified; its new speed has reduced complexity, and many of its weapon classes are objectively inferior.  Between the removal of poise and the unbalanced weapon classes, a lot of player choice feels as though its been removed.  Most of all, casting has been more or less eradicated as a viable PvP aspect.  Every spell can be dodged, Focus Points limit their ability to sustainably battle, and even when they do hit, spells just aren't as significant as a good straight sword two-hit R1/Right Bumper combo.I could go on about a few more negatives, all of them equally nitpicky Souls geek things, but the point is that the game is just feels a little less deep than Dark Souls I or II, specifically in the PvP.  It's still incredibly enjoyabale, especially outside of the multiplayer, but if you're anything like me, the reduction of viability of using axes or spells (or whatever you want to use that day) will irk you.  I just feel that the loss of viable build diversity is very sad.I do love this game, and strongly recommend it.  But it lost a few things that I really enjoyed in previous installments."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 20, 2017              This game is one of the best games i've ever played :) It has one of the best lores i've learned, extremely challenging, The experience becomes better if you talk about the story with your friends and have the volume on while playing :) and much much more <3 In my personal experience 70% percent of the people playing this game are using 3rd party program or cheat engine or at least around that percentage >.< Thats really unfortunate. So what i highly recommend you to do before activating   Play online   or going online in this game is >>> Back up your ds1, ds2 and ds3 file :) How do you do that? Go to >>> This computer or This PC > Users > your computers name :p > App Data > Roaming and click on ds3 or any of the ds games :) So now you've got a folder thats    Users ID   that folder contains inside of it a file, That file is your in game progressing save :p Please back up that file by manually copy and pasting it from time to time or even better everytime you close the game ^.^ Paste it into your other Hard Drive ( HHD) or anywhere you feel like it'll be safe in :)Why do you wanna do all of that? Is firstly because Steam Cloud doesn't support this or any ds games :) So it's not like Csgo, dota2 or many other games that save automatically in your steam account :) so because some hackers with bad intentions not only kill people unfairly and gain little to no fun >.< But they also have bad ways to force a bugged or a hacked item into your inventory that can cause a soft ban or corrupt your files :/ or simply dropped hacked items for you to pick up if you are new to the game that will ruin your system :<I lost my account twice first time i lost my level 210 character is because i formatted my computer and i didn't know that steam cloud doesn't support ds3 :< And the second time i lost my level 281 character is because i picked up a bugged or a hacked item that ruined my system so i decided to delete all my save files >.< and i've read later on that it's not needed to delete the acccount but the character itself and what i also read that the soft ban ( soft ban is a temporary that prevents you from playing online untill you delete or remove the hacked bugged item that you picked up) will go away after couple of weeks but i haven't experienced it myself and i hope i wont ever again >.< Thank you and i wish you the best of luck and a wonderful experience on your ds3 journey :)"

It was later discovered by other people that this value was only turned on during what was thought to be hyperarmor frames at the time, and that poise damage is constantly being calculated at all times but you are only able to resist stagger during attacks or actions with hyperarmor framesâ (source: http://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/poise)Another problem encountered during the run is that the game sometimes freezes for few seconds, or completely, which seems to be related in a bug with nvidia drivers; in fact, rolling back drivers and changing some option in control panel helped to reduce a lot this problem   it is always present the possibility to play co op or pvp by placing signs with dedicated stones or using red eye orbs for the invasionsGRAPHICS 8/10The game is a big step ahead; it looks very beautiful, even if the particle details arenât the best out there Some game zones will make you keep your breath and will be easy to get screenshot for your desktopSome assets are taken from Bloodborne, for the player, this time, is a good thingIt is also well optimized: with the configuration test we have a solid 1080p@60fpsSOUNDS 9/10Sound is almost perfect in every situation, in particular during boss fight where every appearance change is accompanied by sounds change.The sound of the environment is well recreated while some sounds of the undead will freeze your blood in veins             PROS                                                                                           - Gameplay                                                                                 - Graphics                                                                               - Sounds CONS-      Atavistic defects of the series-      Camera in certain situationsFINAL VOTE: 8,5/10"

Using tactical maneuvers like trying and failing to get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ outta the way of the big, imposing death swoops, slices, stabs and smashes, dead guy dies a lot, but he's got mad perseverance and keeps coming back for more. You'll encounter memorable characters like  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t Hammer Guy ,  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t Magic Lady ,  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t Fleshy Godzilla , and Nemesis from the much beloved Resident Evil 3. Train yourself to use fearsome weapons like Bigâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Hammer, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Monster-Sized Death Sword, Sharp Stick From Hell, Wolverine, or if you're a casual tryhard, you'll use Edgelord's Katana and whine like the little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that dropped it when yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥gets kicked in by a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mountain wielding an even bigger â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mountain. This game is a whale of a time and will have you simultaneously shouting in pain, frustration, anger, and misery. Occasionally you'll feel accomplished, and net a solid amount of spoopcash, only for someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥named Bones Mcstoner to invade and â¥â¥â¥â¥ up yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥with a damn â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t attack that you totally dodged I swear it.

According to the anti-cheat software shoving its head up itsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I, and many, many other players, have been softbanned for no reason. CO-OP does not really exist for me any more, and apparently the invaders have given up on trying to get me as well. I'm basically playing a single player version of a multiplayer game because of some formatting error. On top of all that I deleted my main character because I thought it would fix the error message. So there goes 30 hours of my time, FROM, I hope you're happy. 2. Glitches. This game is riddled with glitches. Some of them allow enemies and other creatures to hop around the screen and attack you at lighning speed in seconds. It was not a framerate issue, it just happened for me. My game would sometimes give me delayed responces as well. Sometimes I would try to roll, but it would not happen. I did the most logical thing and tried to roll again, and I just ended up rolling twice. It was NOT a framerate issue. 3. Online Play. I'm not going to lie. My internet connection is not the best, but I get a decient ammount of bandwith that I have little to no trouble with playing other games in multiplayer mode. Most of, if not all, the games that I invaded orwas summoned into had Lagasaurous-Rex teir lag. Players would SLIDE across the screen in their idle position whilst making damaged gasps and attacking sounds. Enemies and BOSSES would revert to these stances whenever my host was attacked by them. It was incredably easy for me to backstab every enemy due to the extreme lag on FROM's servers. The worst part was the invaders and the bosses. Invaders would do the same thing as the host while attacking in their idle position. invasions turned into a spam fest because no one could tell what the others were doing. When bosses became like this I could not be damaged. I don't know if it was the fact that the boss was nowhere near me due to lag or the fact that an animation had to hit me to damage me. I don't know. However, the fact that this happened is outrageous for a game. Conclusion. Don't buy this game until it has been fixxed. Otherwise you may be banned for no reason, thus limiting the game, become frusterated when glitches ruin your fun, and generally become confused when everyone is in their freaking idle position."

(which usually is a good idea).I got a warning that i had invalid data on my pc, and reading after several threads i decided to remove the game, save games and blacklist in rivatuner (so it wouldnt use it).After redownloading the game, starting fresh (with a xbox360 controller) , i had fun for about a week until yesterday.Yesterday i got a message my account has been penalized and i had been banned from the multiplayer part of the game. So i can no longer co-op  or invade.I have no 3rd party software running , no cheats, no mods and no overlay software (only the steam overlay!).I have read on many forums this thing is all happening automaticly , and from software cant do anyting about it.  im pretty gutted since MP was a crucial part of the game and now i cant play it properly anymore.     And to think i even bought the season pass as well. I wanted to buy the PC version since obviously that is supposed to be the best version , well after this drama i cant really recommend it to anyone.  So either get the console version or avoid it at all cost."

After about a few weeks I was flagged for invalid game data. I was confused and kind of worried about being banned but thought that they would resolve it and not ban me for no reason. Eventually I was randomly penalized for hacking on dark souls 3. At this point I wish I had hacked this game, at least I could have derived some benefit from hacking instead of just having put hours into this game just to get all the progress I made taken from me for no reason. I had some crappy equipment and one good weapon, I have no clue why they think I was cheating. I think this game is fun but they didn't really seem to have any reason to do this and I am really hoping they fix this. This reason and all the other bugs that crash my game is why I do not recommend the game, you might become banned and have them steal the game from you.EDIT: Since then they have unbanned me. I gave the game a negative review for its bad customer service at first. The actual game of Dark Souls 3 is a very fun and rewarding experience for those who really want to try it. I have had a great time playing this game, I just wish they would have done better with their anti-cheat system in the beginning. I would recommend this game in its current state to anyone I know or anyone I do not know."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 13, 2016              Wow, What can't I say good about the game that has me hooked like wildfire. This was my first real playthrough of a souls game, of course after I played it I went out and beat the other 2, just to say I did and also because I fell in love with the Rich Lore of this game. Every item you pick up in the game has a description and most of them can be traced to something in the previous games. You can find subtle hints of things you've seen before in the game and hints about bosses and the purpose of the placements of items. And the gameplay in this one is far more polished than the previous two, (save for the low stamina costs, but to be honest with the way these bosses work, you need to dodge a ton.)From the Very beginning of the game they pit you against a tough boss if your new to the souls series, but don't let anything intimidate you in this game. Take the world of Lordran/Lothric by storm, head in without fear of dying because you probuly will die and there is nothing you can do about it. Just learn from every encounter and be sure to recover your souls. Your in for a wild ride, not for the faint of heart or for those weak in courage. The game has plenty to offer in terms of multiplayer as well. You can team up with 3 other friends to take on the challenges of the game which can be some of the most fun in the game, but beware you are also suseptable to being invaded by another player who wants to take yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥for a ride and then kill you. Then again you could turn to the same method and go invading yourself. The game also has a dueling community, aka a group of players who participate in friendly duels with one another. The latest DLC for the game has streamlined the whole dueling process by adding matchmaking to dueling. You can also do 2v2, 3v3, 4 and 6 man free for alls and more.Final Verdict: Dark Souls 3 is a challenging experience, with a ton of replay Value. The game will grow on you if you let yourself get hooked. Also a great game to play with some friends! BIG NOTICE: CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.This Game is near impossible to play with Keybindings. Get a damn controller if you wanna play."

The Combat is quick and responsive and the enemies feel much more intelligent. The first thing I noticed with DS3 over the others is how incredibly smooth it is. Dodging has never been so fun! They've added a few things to make the initial start a little less aggravating, without over-doing it and making it too easy."

The semi hardcore nature of this game is very addictive and it seems like so many games now a days cater to  casual  gamers and try to hold your hand as much as possible. Dont get me wrong thats not a bad thing, but its a nice feeling when a developer has a certain expectation of you in the game. When developers have that type of respect for gamers, it goes a long way.9/10...now pvp on the other hand.................."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 2, 2016              Will remain a negative review until softban issue is resolved.Note: I was banned during the first ban-wave, FROM claims that the system has been changed meanwhile, but I have no way of verifying this one way or another. I went through almost 4 complete game cycles to get all possible gear and achievements on one character (one additional cycle because Sirris' quest line is made out of really thin paper) and now I got penalised for I don't even know what.Corruption must have happened during NG, as none of my save files (I made a copy before starting each new cycle) were able to remove the Invalid Game Data warning.ââEdit: In light of very recent evidence (FROM coming down from their throne to impart some knowledge upon the unwashed masses) it is clearer now why this approach didn't work. Even the complete removal of all game data after receiving the warning, was no guarantee that you wouldn't get penalised (by design, FROM claims, and contrary to everything the  warning  message said or implied.)ââWhile I had fun exploring and collecting everything, I have absolutely no desire to do it again. Since, let's face it, this game isn't all that deep once you have seen everything at least once before. The NG+ cycles are uninspired and unchanging. PVP is the real endgame and I'm barred from it as I write this. I wouldnât have bothered if rebirth wasn't a thing, if having a character with all gear to choose from didn't have a tangible benefit. Which is another gripe I have with the game (only 5 rebirths per cycle, no forgoing of SLs, you can't re-roll the starting class) but that is another issue, and one I would begrudgingly accept if everything else worked as it should. Which currently it doesn't.Get yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥together FROM. This is just disgraceful.  Update 2016-05-02: Do not bother with Bandai Namco support. I finally got a reply out of them, after a few emails. It was a generic, canned reply saying that I should be patient. Yes, I am patient. Very patient. You have to be, if you are forced to do PVP on the shadow server. Talk about adding insult to injury.Update 2016-05-09: I opened a ticket to see if that works better than email. I linked this review and received a reply within 24 hours, asking me several questions. I answered the questions, but nothing has happened since then.Update 2016-05-13: I don't even care anymore. Praise Steam Family Sharing.Update 2016-05-17: Put in an edit about the warning/ban system as some new information has surfaced. FROM claims that the review system it is working now and that mistakes made previously will be rectified. We shall see."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 3, 2016              You unearth on the graveyard among ash and bones. No rest for the undead again. Or you can use the fancy The Ashen One as your new Maiden in Black calls you, or unkindled as everyone else does. Thereâs a nitpicking explanation for the difference between unkindled and undead. The short version is: you tried to link the fire like Gwyn did in the first game, but was found unworthy of the task. Youâve turned into ash and not into cinder like those who were capable of performing the task. Now you rise again because those who unlike you were good enough as a kindling (Lords of Cinder) have abandoned their thrones. The massive boulders shaped into armchairs that are left in the Firelink Shrine look like distant relatives of tombstones in Hunterâs Dream from Bloodborne. Or rather even archstones from Demonâs Souls since Firelink Shrine now looks a lot more like Nexus (but has a secret dark counterpart like Hunterâs Dream did). The only thing in common (besides the obligatory bonfire) between the old and new location is the complaining knight. This ever present character of hub locations for the series gives you riddled insights on what to do next and reminds you that any hope for success is futile. In the first game heâs greeted you when you got out of the introductory zone. Now heâs at the end of it. Heâs at the borderline between abstract time-space of your base of operations and that real fight that begins according to the messages left by other players.The funniest joke of Dark Souls III is how it reverses the common trope of video games. Your usual path is upwards, from the faubourgs, forests and bogs to the final castle of the ultimate evil. Here you start in it and slowly descend to the foothill and further into the depths where more dangers lurk. That makes you question who you are. And that is the right question for the series, but as usual this mystery is open to interpretation (and largely depends on your actions and choices). Itâs easy to miss even though youâre told directly about it by the NPC. Details like this tend to not be the focus of your attention, which usually is centered on how to deal with the hordes of dangerous enemies trying to stab you on your way to the next bonfire.http://coub.com/view/d6m2vIn the transition from one zone to the other there will be time to just admire the view.Dark Souls III is like a happy marriage: the tricks arenât really new, but it still is titillating and enjoyable. And most importantly you donât wanna trade this comfort for something new because youâre convinced that nothing can be better.In a way this game is more accessible than ever, more robust and fluent. No more riddles about starting gifts; access to the multiplayer is not so far behind the tricky boss fight and AN incredibly punishing (for a beginner) zone. Now you just purchase your white sign soapstone from a vendor in Firelink Shrine. You donât even have to find and rescue this seller of marvelous goods, handmaiden. Sheâs just there. But then again, you have to know what it is youâre buying. You have to know if itâs better to stock up poison-reducing items or packs for arrows for sneaky dragon-killing. You have to be a veteran of the series for that particular pricy key in her stock to immediately catch your attention. Yes, Dark Souls III is a tad easier, but only if youâve already come prepared with the knowledge and loaded with nostalgia. Only then the silhouette of a blacksmith sitting further in the underground cave besides the handmaiden will make your heart beat faster.Self-quoting and straight-up repetition of elements from previous titles is yesterdayâs news about FromSoftware games. If anything, thatâs admirable how essentially doing the same very hardcore and nichÃ© thing again and again theyâve gained such a widespread acknowledgment. Itâs still a far cry from your typical AAA experience, but for a long-time fan it looks more like a remix, like a fevered dream filled with all those memories blended together than a new adventure. The series are at the point of calling exciting new feature a re-introduction of mana bar which wasnât present in the series since Demonâs Souls. Well, itâs blue and shows you the amount of mana you spend to cast spells, which isnât that exciting. Whatâs more interesting is that you also use it for special 2-handed weapon attacks. This introduces you to the new mechanic of balancing two types of estus-flasks if you use spells or goes completely unnoticed if you only use these special attacks occasionally and stick to the old ways. This is how it goes: a bit of this, a touch of that, familiar NPC making a return, a poisonous bog, an underground cavern, a jail with an NPC trapped behind a locked door. Everything is chopped, sliced and added to the brew.Thereâs NPC that kills other NPC and revenge invasion, though implications are far less dramatic. There is a simplistic puzzle with the two elevators far less decorated than in Bloodborne. You do things the same way, look for familiar clues. You jump off the elevators when you see those platforms you can jump off to. If you get bored, the ability to choose a new playstyle is there. Itâs worth noting though that attributesâ reallocation is accessible way far into the game as opposed to Dark Souls II. You can easily miss it altogether on discover it at the point when thereâs just four bosses left, and all of them are just pathetic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Anyway youâre free to choose from melee to magic to bow to something even more exotic. And when you fail with your build optimisation you can always just throw toxic feces at enemy knights. Dozens of armor sets, weapons and rings â enough to justify a replay. You were curious to try out that mechanic that youâve missed on previous playthrough anyway.Second playthrough with the comfort of coming prepared. Now you know which chests are mimics and have time to chuckle at âRegret!â message at the dead end. The structure of the world comes back into focus. Vertically stretched layout with intersections, connections, elevators, traps, closed doors and completely cut-off zones. Geography makes sense now.Even two bonfires mere few dozens of steps away from each other actually make sense when you consider the shortcut you discover later. The story of Dark Souls series revolves around endless cycles of misery and futility of any attempts to overcome it. Youâre not even sure if that is the irony or the prophecy of some kind for the company and its games."

I loath how you can miss a tell and get utterly wrecked for a single stupid mistake. I hate how the AI can some times change it up creating a new pattern of attacks that I wasn't expecting and thus wreck my face.  I hate how even the littlest of foes can murder you in a blink if you're not paying attention... This game is the personification of a dungeon crawl, when you're tired, weak, bleeding. It knows, and it's hungry.Still... I keep going, I keep beating myface against the brick wall untill I finally kill that Onyx weilding monster and lay claim to a greatsword I'm elated to have, will even use for a while as my character was a pyromancer to begin with. I love to hate this game... it's my cathartic rage dump. It's well done, plays beautifully, punishes me for my huberous, and forces me to retreat, train up, and try a different tactic.I'm not the best at this game, I can't waltz through and call it easy, the idea of a no death playthrough is an alien concept in my eyes. Still I've enjoyed every single hour I've dumped into this hate monster, and cannot wait to finally close my undead paws around the next bit of DLC loot."

But all of thim, circle, defend/parry and attack them from behind.And then there are dogs. â¥â¥â¥â¥ dogs."

Dark Souls 3's combat system and mechanics are sound, function properly, and goddamn i wish I could say the same about the first one.Problem; AI. for some reason, when Embered and invaded by mad spirits/dark spirits, trying to parry them or even get a backstab is near impossible, and when you make consecutive hits, all of a sudden, magic parry, adn then your health dwindles down to nothing. So I guess it's all swish swish stab and back away...Still, it take everything into a blender, mashes it up and throws the odd pickle in it, to give it some zest I guess. Even though that ticks me, I thoroughly enjoy it and see it as a great game for new players to try."

However, it is not as complicated as what it looks like from the outside and if a player can beat the difficult entry what you get is a deep, emersive, beautiful game that I would recomend to anyone and nearly everyone. I can say that this is one of my faverouite games and as a newcommer to the series I deeply enjoy it. I highly recommend you get this game especially if you enjoy open world games and RPGs."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 23, 2016              git gudIll be talking about the game, and both of the DLCs in this reviewDark Souls III, a game that'll drag you through locations you wouldn't want to be at, you'll experience dark dungeons, castles guarded by dragons and foggy swamps filled with horrors. I'll bring you both beautiful sights and lots of sorrow from failure.The Dark Souls games is a dark fantasy role-playing series known for its difficulty and unforgiving nature. The story is obscure and is gonna feel very disconnected as most of it is hidden in item descriptions however it is very much worth looking into if you're looking for a story, if you're not the reading type you'll be able to find most if not all of the story on youtube which is also worth a listen.Tuck and RollAfter a lot of experience playing Dark souls, Dark souls II and Bloodborne, I'd say that Dark souls III does have the weakest combat entry in the series. Its somewhere in between Dark souls and Bloodborne, faster enemies which means that the game does favor faster characters and a harder time for those wanting to play as slow Tanky characters, Mages and Pyromancers since they have slow casting times.PROS:     Good and beautiful level design     Has both easy and hard bosses     Gameplay feels fluid     Lots of different armor and weapons      Hidden  sidequests     Weapon Arts     Ash Estus Flasks     Fashion souls - Its great in this one.     Areas feel different.CONS:     Slow casting     Lack of new spells     binoculars casting (look it up if you dont know what it is)     Stamina usage when casting spells.     Player hub makes the game feel less connected.     NPC leveling, 2 loading screens to level up.     Somewhat linear progression.     Anti cheat is unreliable.BASE GAME TL;DR:Game is great even though it favors certain playstyles more than others.DLC 1 - Ashes of AriandelDeath, death everywhere....Ashes of Ariandel is honestly a pretty short and disappointing DLC, while it excels at feeling like a natural extension to the main game, it lacks in content, interesting enemies and areas to explore. The DLC includes 2 bosses, new armor, weapons and a few spells. The few areas the DLC does include are beautiful snow filled mountain tops and vallys, and its recommend to explore.Please do note that hovering the mouse over the black bars in the text will reveal boss names, and could be considered as a spoiler in some cases.The first time I went through the DLC I missed the first boss fight, Champion's Grave Tender & Grave Tender Great Wolf but I later went back to it and I've got to say, its nothing but an average fight, set in a beautiful scene.The second boss fight, Sister Friede and Father Ariandel might be one of my favorites from the entire series, the fight will at times make you go  Wait theres more? , its difficult, its beautiful and its super fun.DLC 2 - The Ringed CityAn old woman quips that she feels like a god, looking over all creation as it races toward the end, the end of everything.This is the end, the end of an era, the last piece of Dark Souls content we'll have... For now, I hope.This DLC features new armor, weapons, spells, regions and bosses, 4 of them.The Ringed City is falling upon itself as this world is coming closer to its end. Wether you found Ashes of Ariandel disappointing this is for you, its a must have.Please do note that hovering the mouse over the black bars in the text will reveal boss names, and could be considered as a spoiler in some cases.The first boss fight, The Demon Princes, one from below, one in pain., lets just start out by saying what an entrance, theres 2 bosses here, and depending on which one you kill first the 2nd phase of the fight will be different, the fight feels great and is very entertaining.The second boss fight, Halflight, Spear of the Church, this fight is kinda weird, if you're playing online another player might be summoned as the boss which brings something completely new to the table.The third boss fight, Darkeater Midir Holy hell, what a fight, this boss is a  secret  boss, I do believe that this is by far the hardest boss in the game, like the full game not just the DLC, this feels like a raid boss, bringing friends is advised... I'll just wait here until I get summoned...The fourth and final boss fight, Slave Knight Gael This might be one of my favorite boss fights in the game, it'll remind you of something you've seen before if you've played Dark souls: Prepare to die. Its fast and a very difficult fight, but lots of fun.The only downside to this was the fact that it wasn't connected to the main game..."

The game is hard until you get powerful weapons.The Dark Souls III is the baby of the Bloodborne and Souls games: it has fast combat system and some areas looks like they are ripped from the Bloodborne and the other things are just Dark Souls things.If you loved Bloodborne's fighting mechanics this game is for you."

If for some reason you haven't herd of this game already, let me give you a quick run-down. Dark Souls 3 has a combat system that is best used to take on eneimes in a 1v1 not a 1v9, when you die you drop all of your hard earned Souls (the games currency) and wake up at the last bonfire you rested at. Dark Souls 3 can get very repetitive at times but that's what many others and I like about the game. If I were you, I would untill Dark Souls 3 is on sale unless you really, really like the Souls series but I personally don't think it's worth 59.99 USD (77.81 AUD). All in all, Dark Souls 3 is definatly worth your time and will keep you occupied (and yelling in agony) for many hours to come."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 11, 2016              I spent my time playing the game and forgot to review it. Welp.For non-fans: If you want to get into the souls games, this isn't a bad place to start, as much as I'd like to say start with Demon's Souls or Dark Souls. Dark Souls 3 is a more accessible title and if you think it's your jam in the first two hours, it's probably going to be your jam for the next 300 hours. So, I am a longtime Souls fan. I love these games more than I should. I love the lore, the world-building, the combat, the ambience, the chracters, the story delivery, the bosses, etc. My opinion is biased. However, maybe not the way it would seem. On the first week of release, I f**king Hated this game. It was boring, easy, and the lore was redundant, or so it seemed. I was obviously awstruck by some events. (I would name them but fans who've yet to play this one will kill me...however, at this point, what souls nerd hasn't played 3?) It took about a month long break after my second time beating it for me to really appreciate it. The first time was on ps4 in which some bosses seemed to have the awesome ability of tanking your framerate. I did complete it, though. Then again on pc. I had hoped it would spark an interest but it didn't. And then I started connecting the game with the previous game(s) (honestly, just DkS 1 because Miyazaki seems to want to forget DkS 2) and then, only then, did my love respark. The Gameplay: It's basically the same as Dark Souls but with omni-directional rolling and weapon arts that diversify your movesets and increase the already skyscraper level skill cap. I don't have any complaints.The Bosses: So, I am biased here. Dark Souls was a game basically about you killing gods. It was so satisfying. In Dark Souls 3, you're killing lords; previous kindlers of the flame. The whole idea is awesome but it does show in the scale of some of the boss fights. Some are far easier than I would like. Luckily, From noticed this and have since then upped the HP of some of the fights to make them feel more challenging or to elongate some very fun fights. (The Dancer needed it and I love her again) Favorite in the game; Pontiff Sulyvahn/ Nameless King. Level Design: Some areas are just fantastically designed. Some stand-outs for me are Lothric Castle, the ever amazing Untended Graves and The-Place-That-Shan't-Be-Named because it's so f**king cool to get there. Unfortunately, there are places that just aren't nearly as interesting such as the Crucifixion Woods and Farron Keep. The game as a whole never quite reaches Bloodborne levels of wonderful level design but it gets quite close. The areas don't diversify in as much of an interesting way as they did in Dark Souls but far more than Bloodborne. The Lore: Wonderful... If you were a fan of Dark Souls lore, you will love digging into DkS 3's lore. Conclusion: It doesn't feel as special as Dark Souls at times but you have to take it as a place in the series. It does well to be the true successor to Dark Souls. It really is the Dark Souls II that we (mainly me) truly were hoping for."

The greatness of every component that makes Dark Souls III is crippled by its poor technical execution and Iâm afraid this is a result of the fansâ and journalistsâ attitude towards the game. Praising without questioning has given the developers a free pass with the end result being countless bugs and problems that went unfixed throughout an entire series making their way into its finale.                Dark Souls III is a good game that combines most of the great elements of its predecessors into one final blow. The impact of the finale is subject to each gamer perception towards the series. In my case, I said that the best way to improve on the series is to find the balance between its two predecessors while focusing on fixing the problems of the past and Dark Souls III did only half of that. How important each half is? I guess the time spent playing the game can be interpreted as an answer to that.Pros:+ Impressive artistic design+ Epic soundtrack+ Mysterious and captivating story+ Good level design+ Refined combat system+ Greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series+ Atmospheric+ Good itemization+ Fun PvPCons:- Bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions- Some issues with mouse & keyboard- Linear world design with a few exceptions- Perhaps too much fan service- The graphics quality and graphics related problems- Little incentive to continue with NG+ and onwards- Weapons balance issues due to Poise stat having no effect- The lack of proper support for the Online component- Annoying lag in Online playRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/05/dark-souls-iii-review.html"

In most common infamous case. A hacker happen to join into your game. they can do weird stuff like force adding stats, forcing items into your characters and mess up your save files and you'll be ban and burn in hell for it. and there are many hackers out there. game will force you to delete your savefiles.  all those time you invest into leveling will be gone. If you wanna buy this game to experience online PVP coop. you have to accept that you risk lose your characters and all your sht at anytime. all those hours, days, weeks invested, gone.  its really frustrate. its a great game tho if you wanna buy it and dont care much about pvp and just wanna enjoy sp story. but you have been warned."

You could end up in that sliver of a statistic. Don't bother emailing support either because they just reply with automated emails and if you try to contact them again they threaten to perma ban you just for basically bothering them."

I haven't played Bloodbourn but I'm still including it."

This game is the next entry into the Dark Souls series, featuring the same 3rd-person RPG gameplay of it's predecessors. It  takes place in the same world as the previous titles(though now in Lothric), and includes all the expected puzzles, traps, bloodthirsty enemies, complex/beautiful environments and secrets you could ever want. Dark Souls has a brand new engine this time around, the same as that of Bloodborne; you can really feel the difference in smoothness and graphic quality.Positives:The legendary difficulty is back(they patched it in before release).This installment easily has the most in-depth fighting system of the series.The lore and narrative are still puzzles in their own right, and there's a lot of it.The game is on par for PC options.Most areas will run at 60fps if your computer is within spec. The game is beautiful.Soul memory is GONE! WOOO! Also, enemies won't disappear after you kill them a bunch.The boss design, as usual, is on point. They are all unique, scary, and challenging.The soundtracks are amazing, they come to life in the game's best moments.The game start-to-finish without doing any side stuff takes an average of 30 hours.The level design is miles ahead of Dark Souls II, you'll notice that immediately.Veterans of the series will be familiar with most systems, like sliding into a new comfy chair.Combat has been entirely reworked, down to each individual weapon. Dual-wielding is viable!Classes don't lock you into a playstyle, choose what you want and build on it. You can respec too!PVP is better than ever, especially with the new covenants!Online functionality has been expanded.Based on the ending, this is probably not the final Souls gameNegatives:The world is kind of linear in some areas, but it's not very noticeable.There are a few framerate and graphical issues. Some areas are worse than others.There is noticeable pop-in.Some grinding is neccesary. (May not be a negative for you!)Keyboard and mouse controls are just okay(using a controller is highly recommended)(Yeah, that's it. Wow.)So is it worth it?A thousand times yes. This game takes the best of the previous games and expands upon them. The Souls formula has been entirely reworked, and outfitted with the new Bloodborne engine to deliver a beautiful, polished product. Veterans should feel right at home here, as everything they know and love is in the game waiting for them. Those new to Dark Souls will have no problem using this game as an entrance to the series, as this is really, truley, the ultimate Dark Souls experience.(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up! Feel free to add me and check out my Steam Group.)"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 16, 2016              An honest, spoiler-free reviewDespite the occasional, and rather frustrating, technical quirks, most of which will be patched sooner or later, this game is a masterpiece and one of the very few of its kind - if not the only.With well-designed mechanics, revised smart AI, complex map designs and innovative environmental hazards that'll challenge you at every turn, you'll be punished harshly for even the slightest mistakes but rewarded greatly with progression - with every success, there's a real feeling of accomplishment the likes of which you won't find in any other game.With awesome bossfights, beautiful BGM, intriguing lore, engaging questlines, vast and dynamic atmospheres that'll leave you in awe and limitless customisation with which to compliment your style of gameplay, you will find yourself immersed like never before. With that said, this game is not for the faint of heart - always expect the unexpected. The world around you is always changing; you will travel across many landscapes, each of which will surprise you with widely different experiences. And you'll encounter countless NPCs, from minor enemies to major characters, each with their own variances, distinct backgrounds and unique personalities.But  Dark Souls 3  is very mature; it doesn't hold your hand and show you how to play or where to go. And with a game this extensive, it can be very easy to miss most of the aforementioned details. For retuning fans and/or generally experienced players, this only makes the game that much more fun as it encourages you to venture earnestly. For newcomers though, it can make the game seem very bland at the start. Even more so, the combat system in this game, whilst fluent, is very comprehensive making it difficult to grasp. But you can always invite a friend into your world, or any other player(s), to help you out. So, with a bit of patience and tolerance, I doubt not that this game can capture just about anyone. And you won't have worry about competitive gameplay until you near end-game, if you can make it that far. To conclude with, Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of the Dark Souls' franchise, has confirmed that this game would be the last of its series. Would it not be fair to assume that he'd want to go out with a bang? So expect great things to come for this game in the near-future."

        "Comments": "Posted: September 29, 2016              So... after playing Dark Souls on Old Gen, Dark Souls 2 (which was also on Old Gen) and Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin, I finally was able to play Dark Souls 3 and this was my impression:I had a lot of fun with the old battle mechanics from Dark Souls mixed with the Engine of Bloodborne, which I couldnÂ´t play sadly. I enjoyed the new Character Story Lines, the Weapons, the Bosses, and the PvP System! The possibility to delay attacks was a good move on the developers side. It really added some spice into it. I also played through every ending and they were great too and had their own satisfaction, even though they werenÂ´t longer than 5 Minutes each. But if you played the other Dark Souls games, you are used to that. I also enjoyed almost all enemy types, and their unique attack patterns, which made each enemy a challenge, especially in a group.But now for the bad parts:- Since games like that depend on a good framerate to dodge attacks properly, I was severly disappointed in the frame     drops that happened while I was playing it. They did fix it now, but it still annoyed me pretty much.- The gameÂ´s co-op, which has a big impact on the online experience (like the old parts), was enjoyable, but only to some          extend. For example, many coveneants which let you spawn automatically in friends or foes world, were broken and   didnÂ´t work, or at least on very few occasions.    On top of that, the gameÂ´s community is still one of the saltiest of all games. People healing in a summoned 1v1,   gankers, hunting for invaders that want to farm their coveneant, and even hackers. Yes, I know, the Community doesnÂ´t   anything to do with the Gameplay, but it influenced my opinion on the package alltogether.- The Character Creation. There is a lot to customize from forehead to nose, but there where little things that annoyed me    like the incapability to make a special hair colour. You couldnÂ´t make bright hair colours, like green or something like    that. It mostly looked bad, at least on my screen. What also annoys me is the low variety on Hair- and Beardstyles.But with all that apart, I had a lot of fun playing this game, alone and with friends, and I am looking forward to the DLCs and more deadly surprises. I would give this game a 9/10, with the addition, that new comers to the series also can play it without thinking: WhatÂ´s going on here?, because this is what Dark Souls is about. You have to figure it out by yourself, while the prequels didnÂ´t have a huge impact on DS 3, except references and backstory wise.WELL.I hope this review helped you on deciding whether to buy this game or not. IÂ´d recommend it and leave you.Prepare to die."

Dark Souls 3 is fantastic, but unfortunately at the moment I cannot recommend it because of the utterly broken anti-cheat system.Cheaters are currently able to (and quite easily so) get innocent players permanently banned, as well as forcibly modifying stats, wiping inventories, etc. As a result, the online is unplayable for anyone who doesn't want to risk having their save ruined and get permanently banned from the online as a result. As time goes on, cheaters doing this will get more and more common, until the entire community dies off. Until Fromsoft/Namco Bandai does something to remedy the situation, I cannot recommend this game, especially not at full price."

Ever since I first played Dark Souls years ago, I fell in love with the franchise. It was the first Souls experience to me. That game showed me that games can still be very challenging, with amazingly well made fantasy worlds including all sorts of nightmarish creatures. Dark Souls 3 continues the epicness the earlier ones had. I love this game, even if some moments felt impossible or quite frustrating lol. It has much of the same old gameplay mechanics from previous games, but with new additions too and the combat is mostly fast-paced.I feel like it's a great mix of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, without the dash-dodge of BB. The world itself in Dark Souls 3 is amazing in my opinion, not as well made as the perfect design in Dark Souls with those upper and lower journeys, which is the best in the series. But it's still really cool and you can basically go visit every place you see in the distance eventually. That's one thing I love about these games, to feel like you actually are in this huge unkown mysterious world. As previous games, DS3 doesn't hold your hand. You have to figure out where to go, how to fight enemies and bosses, learn their weakness and patterns to win and death will teach you again.There were few areas or enemies which I didn't like so much because of reasons, but that is a part of these games. I do love how DS3 pays tribute to DS1 in few ways, but I won't go into more detail about that.The soundtrack is soooo fantastic and introduces many cool songs, which fit well in the intense boss fights to make them even greater :D.New monster design is mostly amazing, as I said it reminds me of Bloodborne with certain opponents. Also some of the monsters feels like, as if they were taken inspiration from Berserk manga again as the creator is a fan of it, which is of course really great. I have to say that the boss design and fights are some of the best I have ever encountered, there are many memorable ones and at least 3 were really tough to me. One of the bosses felt a bit disappointing because of the way to defeat it, but was still so cool. I think I did every boss fight as solo, except one. And when you do it alone, the feeling and adrenaline rush is so much greater. The last boss of DS3 could very well be the hardest fight I've ever fought in games and I loved that, even harder than Artorias of DS1. Part of it could be because having a different build than in previous games so it honestly felt impossible, I dunno. But oh boy...it was just insane and such a thrilling fight. Lots of suffering, but eventually when you survive alone these kind of encounters, that feeling of victory is so good. I don't think many other games give that satisfaction and this is one big reason I love the Souls games. Fighting alone in the dark places, against a gigantic or just ultra aggressive bosses is simply one incredible feeling.The multiplayer is similar to DS1. When you summon friends for co-op, they can help you on the road a long time or help kill a boss which is nice. Not badly done like in DS2 where you disappear after killing a couple enemies. I've read many being disappointed with the game, like having connection issues or getting banned for no reasons. Which sucks. But I personally barely had any issues as my Chloe in my 60h+ journey, there was perhaps only 5-6 times when I couldn't enter boss fog door to help a fellow player after he summoned me. Because of connection lag, but that's it.Well it seems I ended up writing more than I first planned :). I say Dark Souls 3 is definitely a worthy send-off to the franchise, as it is informed to be the last one. An epic dark journey and amongst my most favorite experiences ever. I recommend this to those who want to experience challenging and really cool gaming moments. For fans of Souls it's a must.10/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 16, 2017              One of my favourite Souls Series game after Dark Souls I,It's just too beautiful yet brutal to play. PROS  Graphics One of the best thing about DS III is the graphics, too beautiful and you can even sit on a spot and enjoy the view of the world. Stories and Lore I really love the story that happens in DS III. Main storyline, Side Quest storyline and DLC storyline are very interesting and fun.  The lore of the bosses interesting but most of them are sad and sorrow. Weapons and Armor Lots of interesting weapons and armor in the game. There are some weapons that are specially designed for PVP, and using off meta weapons against player will surprise them. There are not best weapons for PVE since you can use any weapon you like against them. Fashion > Defence, and DS III provide lots of badass armor for player and you can build any cosplay you like. Gameplay and Mechanics Souls games always contain rolling and dodging, It's combat is just too fun for me. You can level up to Lv802, switching playstyle as you wish, and rebirth(respec/relocate) up to 5 times per character. Feels good to parrying and backstabing enemies.  CONS The only bad things I found in DS III is PVP. The delay in PVP is very sucks since sometimes you thought you dodge the attack but it hit you anyway. Sometimes you see enemy player sliding towards you instead of running. Really hope FROM could fix this issue. Invasion is not fun anymore. Most of the time they just keep running away from you and waste your time. Even invaders themself also keeps running away. But I still love the game anyway, just can't stop playing it. Definitely recommend to anyone out there who loves RPG. 9.9/10"

The pure challenge and skill you need to beat the DLC is incredible and it will not be an easy challenge.- Offers you a lot of variation with the classes you can do as you can go for a Magic or a Combat character.- The speedrunning community are lovely, if you ever wanted to go into this category.Cons:- With it being so challenging, it may be 'too much' as you could give up with the game entierly. (git gid)- The online play can be very annoying as if you don't have any friends who play this game it will be hard to fight off against multiple players online to beat them and get an offering.- If you're wanting to complete covenant by getting 30 offerings it can be a chore as I grinded for multiple hours to get the drops from specific enemies. (Unless you get them from online play.)- It can be very repetitive and boring if you keep doing the NG+ saves.Ultimately, I think this game is a 9/10 and is definitely worth buying (Even the DLC)"

        "Comments": "Posted: June 8, 2016              Online play is absolutely terrible. -People you summon might be ice-skating around and the same goes for invaders, hitting you with no animation and being impossible to attack. When being summoned to another hosts world you might have similar problems with lagging and even NPCs being statues taking dmg 5 seconds after being hit.-Covenants are absolutely broken. Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades are the same thing and both share dependancy on way of the blue users. Not only does the way of the blue player need to be around the same level and weapon upgrade level they also need to have not defeated the area boss, so this leads to people never getting summoned as a blue in 200+ hours of gameplay. The matchmaking is even broken beyond that allowing some people to be consistently summoned as blues due to being prioritized for unknown reasons, making everyone else wait forever. So hope you will be one of the prioritized players or you will never be able to get any PvP with those 2 covenants ever.-Rosarias Fingers covenant is also completely useless, you never need to equip the covenant item as you can invade as any other covenant except for mound makers and Sunbros and be always rewarded with pale tongues which are the reward for Rosarias covenant. As a result players end up with hundreds of Pale tongues that they can do absolutely nothing with since every covenant item is worthless beyond 30. The general feeling you get is that the covenant system is an afterthought added into the game with no depth whatsoever. Grind 30 of each item and never bother with the covenants again.-Invading is broken. You invade a host who can have 3 phantoms at the same time, each with Estus flasks to heal themselves and the host with 25% increased health due to being embered. If you somehow manage to kill a phantom the host can immediately summon another. So have fun invading into a 4v1 gankfest with the latency inconsistencies mentioned.Play through the game offline and experience the different endings and never look back and never go online and you will have a good time. If you try PvP or online play you will be gravely disappointed."

The level design is more linear than the first game but it still has it's share of optional areas, bosses and items you reach by exploring.The graphics look gorgeous in my opinion and i found myself taking a lot of screenshots, which i never do. I would say the game is kind of easier than the first two games but that's probably because i played them first and gained some experience. However i would not advise people to play this first because then the first two games would feel very clunky and that may turn some people off from them.I really have not much to say about it because the points i made in the review for the first game are mostly valid in this game as well. It's still the good old amazing Dark Souls experience. (Though i would say that i like the first game a lot more)."

When being summoned to another hosts world you might have similar problems with lagging and even NPCs being statues taking dmg 5 seconds after being hit.-Covenants are absolutely broken. Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon Blades are the same thing and both share dependancy on way of the blue users. Not only does the way of the blue player need to be around the same level and weapon upgrade level they also need to have not defeated the area boss, so this leads to people never getting summoned as a blue in 200+ hours of gameplay. The matchmaking is even broken beyond that allowing some people to be consistently summoned as blues due to being prioritized for unknown reasons, making everyone else wait forever. So hope you will be one of the prioritized players or you will never be able to get any PvP with those 2 covenants ever.-Rosarias Fingers covenant is also completely useless, you never need to equip the covenant item as you can invade as any other covenant except for mound makers and Sunbros and be always rewarded with pale tongues which are the reward for Rosarias covenant. As a result players end up with hundreds of Pale tongues that they can do absolutely nothing with since every covenant item is worthless beyond 30. The general feeling you get is that the covenant system is an afterthought added into the game with no depth whatsoever. Grind 30 of each item and never bother with the covenants again.-Invading is broken. You invade a host who can have 3 phantoms at the same time, each with Estus flasks to heal themselves and the host with 25% increased health due to being embered. If you somehow manage to kill a phantom the host can immediately summon another. So have fun invading into a 4v1 gankfest with the latency inconsistencies mentioned.Play through the game offline and experience the different endings and never look back and never go online and you will have a good time. If you try PvP or online play you will be gravely disappointed."

I've played both 1 and 3 and can't wait to play more of this kind of game from From. It's sad to see that it's the last one of the series but that only makes this that much more worth it.The Dark Souls series is my favourite series due to all that it is. The game has a way of gripping you, entrancing you not in amazing graphics (which truly the graphics aren't bad, actually quite good), or instructional guided questlines with a straightforward story (which again, there is a story, yet it's truly hidden and you must be a true fan to really understand half of what goes on), but in difficulty, punishment, and overcoming new challenges. It's amazing to see a game that some can finish in 1 hour, and others spend 200 hours, but both can get the same great takeaway of challenge.This game has given me amazing memories. I highly respect those who put their effort into bringing this game to us. Thank you."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 21, 2016              Finished Dark Souls 3 after an intense 11 days. With a Soul Level of 116. Spoilers from here on.In short, it's a great Souls game. It feels very focused in most aspects. Changing covenants is easier, armor upgrades are gone, stats are trimmed down, the world feels tighter, grinding for upgrade materials wasn't necessary. I also liked the slightly improved weapon infusing system. There is now a more clear way to infuse weapons with each  elemental  and still have stat scaling while there are  simpler  infusions available of each kind for better base damage output but no scaling at all. Sounds complicated when reading but it's the easiest upgrade system so far. Another mechanical change is that the camera and player movement feel more similar to Dark Souls 1 which I prefer over the feel of Dark Souls 2. I enjoyed the pacing and focused design. Reminds me of Demon's Souls.This more focused design also shows itself in the world and bosses. There are fewer bosses and the game generally felt lighter and shorter, seeing DS2. It by no means lacks content though. Especially compared to Dark Souls 2, the world feels more believable and cohesive. The areas themselves are also better designed and most importantly to me, offer much better boss encounters than its predecessor. This makes me most happy as the bosses in DS2 were for the most part lackluster. I thoroughly enjoyed almost each and every boss for their unique designs, unique behaviors and unique flow of battle. Interestingly enough I had the by far easiest time so far in any Souls game with DS3. Not sure if it stems from the experience in the series but on the other hand I've heard of friends with tales of horror about certain bosses which I managed to down on my first or second try. In terms of music Demon's Souls and Dark Souls offer more haunting and memorable tracks but there were several nice ones here that caught my attention. Abyss Watcher and Prince Lothric boss fight music namely. The cast of NPC and the questlines were well done with some personalities being nice additions to the Souls series. To my understanding this will be the final entry in the Dark Souls franchise, so it was nice to have references and nods to the whole franchise, starting way from Demon's Souls. I enjoyed reading weapon, armor, spell and item descriptions, vaguely hinting at the players past achievements but the throwbacks don't end here, by far they don't. The blacksmith is the very same Andre of Astora from the first Dark Souls which surprised me since this is taking place apparently a long time after the events of the first game. While him being the single only major identical NPC, I still would have liked it more if he at least was a descendant. Ah well, it was breaking the immersion a bit. There is a fine line between recognizing heritage and recycling and for the most part it's thankfully the former but having seen all the content, there are areas where I would not blame someone for using the word  recycled . Anor Londo is actually not one of those though as it was a very small area, basically a run-up to a boss, so I was absolutely fine with its appearance. Most of all it did not feel like a cheap copy-paste but made sense in the lore and world. Time passed, so it was decaying and crumbling, very well done. Sadly though the existence of Silver Knights was not only done beyond a little nod but felt copied. They added few new attacks but they were the same old Silver Knights with the same old gear, not even brittled or broken to show signs of time! That was a big immersion breaker and I did not enjoy facing them which only became sadder at the amount. The area could have become much more memorable and impactful by making the Silver Knights wear broken, torn-apart armor, maybe even broken weapons and slower, less lively behavior. The way they are depicted though is not well done.Later on when you end up in the Untended Graves there is an interesting  Aha  moment upon realizing it's the starting area but that gets replaced by a  Why  moment when you realize it's not that the original area changed its tone and time but this is a parallel world/different area?! Dynamically changing the area from a certain point in the game would have been better. You fight a variant of the same boss and later on fight Black Knights. Similarly to the Silver Knights with almost no differences to Dark Souls 1 but worse as the location does not make much sense. Shame.Thankfully these  recycled  occurrences were not too much, so I could forget about them once hitting subsequent areas which did not have these issues at all. All in all, I am glad that the Dark Souls franchise is ending as I want to see FromSoftware build a new world with different mechanics, different ideas without expectations & shackles that come with a franchise. From a technical point, Dark Souls 3 has network issues which I have not encountered in previous games. Frequently summoned players become glitched, lacking any animations and just glide which makes for a subpar multiplayer experience. Same happens to the player as a summon in that no enemy or boss has any animations which made for several severely anti-climatic boss fights where this issue obviously occurred for multiple summons who could hammer on a glitched boss without any repercussions. It's not the majority of the multiplayer experience but happens more often than is acceptable.Other than that the game shows stutter. It was only mildly annoying and never became a major issue for me thankfully. What did bug me were the load times when browsing through the inventory. The larger images take a second to show which annoyed me.Despite the lengthy criticism, the positives outweigh them by a landslide and the ups are much, much higher than the lows. Dark Souls 3 is a very good Souls game and stands tall on its own with many of the most memorable and enjoyable areas and boss fights in the whole franchise. I am eagerly awaiting new content, so I have a reason to play more of this gem of a game."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 1, 2018              This is, in my personal opinion, the best game ever made.The bosses are amazing, the game's areas are detailed, the graphics are beautiful and the PVP is hilarious. You can be going through an area and a guy with only a loincloth and a torch could whip you into shape, or maybe a guy comes in with heavy armor and a huge sword and he dies in one hit. It's up to chance.Additionally, the game has just this right amount of challenge. It's not impossible, but it isn't going to hold your hand either. The first boss seems impossible when you first see it, but then you learn his moveset and pattern. After getting to NG+5 or so, you can go in with no armor or weapons and parry him backwards to death. The game has traps and things you wouldn't know from your first playthrough. If you play the game through twice, you already know most of the game by heart because you have to. It forces itself into your memory and makes itself unforgettable. All of the experiences you've ever had in the game will be with you until you die.I recommend this game and all of its DLC. Get it on sale if you want, though it is definitely worth the full price I paid."

I personally glad for the Game lived up to the Hype. And yet, Gameplay feels more like Dark Souls 1 with the Bloodborne built-in graphic engine with no power stance skill (DS II feature) and non-upgradable Armor set in-game, require Skill over stats, leveling on this game it's only 1/3 way to Git Gud, the rest are majorly depending on your Skills and weapon usage.it's true gameplay last around 30 Hours, i had completed the game around 28 Hours,  and i had feeling this is shortest Dark Souls game in DS Franchise. Class: DeprivedWeapon: Broadsword+10 (Except Yhorm)Level: 161 (I used level cheater due to busy work day and increased VIT for avoiding Phat ROLL)Magic: Homeward Cast only (No Other Sorcery/Miracles Used)Style: Solo Mode (No Co-op)Game features really beautiful Orchestra Music Soundtrack, especially on Bossfights and Main Menu Theme.Game also required beefy rig in order to run it, let say GTX 960 with 4GB graphic memory is at least for 1080p constant, i'm encountering stuttering issues especially when entering Road of Sacrifices and Slow loading textures when passing through area/door, but it seems recent patches has fixed this issues [1.05].+ Epic Bossfight in-game (Epic way to die in-game too!)+ creatively well designed enemies AI (Movement and Attack)+ returning elements from DS PTDE+ Atmospheric and Beautiful world of Lothric+ Beautiful Soundtracks in-game- Gameplay feels too short for A-RPG genre (30 Hours long) for first run- Plenty of Shortcuts, world seems smaller.-  Does not open from this side  door bruh.....Despite in short of lengthiness, still this is really the best Dark Souls yet... and it's final one according to Miyazaki (The Director), reported on working new title IP recently.

Worth at least 2 playthroughs (easily more) as you will miss things on your first time playing. Highly recommend if you are looking for a vastly replayable, challenging game. World and art design are also very memorable, especially paired with one of the best soundtracks I have heard. Overall, this is easily one of my favourite games of all time.Side Note: I like this game so much I ran around collecting 107 pieces of women's jewlery for an achievement...."

The graphic engine update really helped this game along, many many veterans of the series say this is too casual and not as good as the others but I disagree, it's different but still challenging.Dark souls 3 uses an upgraded combat system/engine from bloodborne, it's faster, more aggressive and more engaging. It doesn't have any of the ridiculous difficult crap from the first game but is still very challenging. There's an enourmous selection of weapons and spells on offer to help you trek through lothric and take down your foes. I adore the gothic castles and locations in the game. Melee, magic, ranged, so many ways to play through this game. The DLC is also fantastic and adds lots to the story. I hope some day we see more Dark Souls games, I feel I need it in my life :)"

        "Comments": "Posted: June 27, 2017              Dark Souls 3 is a great game for all who loved the series, and is especially more forgiving to newcomers. The game has a greater focus on gameplay and less emphasis on story, which basically means less talking and more killing. The PC port brings us better framerate and graphics, and that adds to the beauty of this gem. I definitely recommend anyone who wants a game with great mechanics to buy this game and play it...Offline.On the PC port, the online gameplay is utter cancer. How so many hackers are allowed to roam free without any repercussions is beyond me. You will literally despise being invaded or invading players that either clip through attacks, have infinite FP or stamina, or just ghost through the entire area, literally unkillable. How Steam or From allows this nonsense to go on unchecked and letting these hackers get away with all this is beyond me. I'm all for the modding community that wishes to mod their game, BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEAVE THAT FOR OFFLINE PLAY. Seriously, Steam...or From...anyone. Ban modded saves from being playable online and let people play in peace!....Oh. Other than that, this is a great game and you should definitely buy it for a great experience...Offline. Until those hacking bastards are banned from any online play."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 27, 2017              I enjoy the first Dark Souls up until Ornstein and Smough and the DLC areas, after it becomes such a boring game. I enjoy going through the entirety of Dark Souls 3, it has far lesser gimmicks and DPS checks than the first game. The pace feels much better in 3, I guess. While I still mourn for a return of a fantasy area like Darkroot Basin/Garden <3, Dark Souls 3 still holds up with its art direction, areas have distinct and memorable set pieces, with plenty of details and good atmosphere. I found this game having some really good/consistent level design. Cathedral of the Deep, Grand Archives, Irithyll, Irithyll Dungeon, and Archdragon Peak are some mentions. Unlike Dark Souls 1 and 2, there were no bad areas, disappointing in some ways? yes, but regardless there is plenty to them and doesn't have unfinished areas that have nothing to offer. I think  story  in these games doesn't exist. The characters are good. I consider these to be separate from the narrative. The main ones are a lot more engaging this time around. The Lords of Cinder give off much more personality compared to the Lord Souls of Dark Souls 1: Nito, Gwyn, Witch and Pigmy. They're boring emotionless characters and don't even have much lore behind them. Abyss Watchers, Lothric, Aldrich, feel much more human and interesting to me and this is something I say in my reviews but if I feel that it's usually due to good setup.  It has the best enemy design, Outrider Knights, Sulyvahn Beasts, Fire Demons, Corvian Knights, these can be their own bosses. They're really tough enemies and there are so many through out the levels as you go. Anyways, here are some things I found flawed the game. -Poise is turned off for you but not the enemies, that already kills off a bunch of strategy and build variety. You can be staggered by the littlest thing mid swing/end animation. -Enemies have the same wind up for more than one move that requires a different response, or far too little of a windup. You will notice this issue in the Pontiff fight. -Bonfires. There are many of them but they do not restrict the challenge having to go through a level. There are just bonfires that are useless and serve no purpose for being there whatsoever. You can usually see a bonfire from behind another. They really kill the immersion of the world and makes it feel a lot more like checkpoints.The Multiplayer. I didn't think it would be this bad, but it is mediocre. So many things that were previously established as successful gameplay mechanics and loved by the community have all been ridden to hell. And yes change is good, but this is not good change. This is too extreme and unfitting.-PVP: Armor used to have a point, now it doesn't. Magic used to add variety and stand its own now it doesn't. Dark souls 3 PvP is weapon vs weapon. Rolls cost no stamina, everyone can heal, phantoms of any kind and the host, poise isn't a thing, it's hyper armor because that's how it was in BloodBorne. It worked in Bloodborne because that was a much simpler game with limited equipment and mechanics built around this. You can't do that with the already ESTABLISHED Dark Souls. It just doesn't work. -The coop: While works most the time will just time out or be a huge lag fest if it works. I've been summoned by people for bosses and have been unable to enter the fog gate many times with 2 other phatoms while the host is stuck fighting a boss with scaled hp. Bosses will remain in a static pose, sorta like the  T-pose  but will be broken and unable to attack. -Latency and framerate: On going problems with the souls games. Sure in previous games it was fine, I can understand. It was their first time at it but 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing games down the line and these issues are still present? come on hire a competent company to port your damn games. Lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Dark Souls 2 to me will stay the one and only Dark Souls where PvP is a thing. Good poise system, over time everything is quite balanced. B-Team listened to their community and made proper changes through out and look at the game now, the most populated souls game to date STILL. The rock-paper-scissors principle gameplay isn't present and that's the best balanced a PvP game can do. Invading is instant, co-op too and the connections are great.Don't buy this game for PvP, the community is already dead and it's hard to even find fights just like Dark Souls 1. Unless you want to keep waiting 5 hours for an opponent. Either Miyazaki only directs the PvE aspect and someone else directs the PvP aspect because time and time again he has proven to be incompetent and unaware as â¥â¥â¥â¥. I recommend the game solely for the PvE. It's a great experience, but I don't think this game is worth full price because so much has been taken away and restrict the replay value hardcore."

        "Comments": "Posted: February 2, 2017              So nice I bought it twice. Imported it for the Xbox One, played through it about four times. Beautiful game, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Xbox version due to the 900p 30fps frame drops (yes, really). Absolutely a gem of a game, right up there for GOTY for me with Persona 5. The soundtrack is probably my favorite, but the best Souls game is easily Dark Souls. However, DS3's port is so much better that i'd have to recommend it over 1 or 2. Pros- Top tier music, as always- Summoning is at it's best, it's not off and on like in other Souls games- The max HP reduction from DS2 is gone. That was and will always be a horrible idea. Dark Souls is about skill first, then trial and error. To punish a player for dying and trying to learn from mistakes was a â¥â¥â¥â¥ up on FromSoft team B's part. - The landscapes. Jesus. It's really so beautiful, especially at the throwback location (won't spoil it) after the chapel. Cons - Gimmicky boss fights. Not saying they all are, but Yhorm? Really??? The deacons? Why even give them a boss health bar? Pointless fights, even if one was a reference to Demon's Souls. - Length. For the final game in the series, this game was not long enough. You could just tell they were going to release DLC, you could feel it after beating the game. Though the ending does tie everything up (kinda, not really) there's just not enough substance there for it to feel like a full game. - Continuity. Remember in DS1, how everything was connected? From firelink to anor londo, to practically anywhere, the game told you how you got there, and about 90% of the time, you could even see the places you were, or will be soon. It felt great, kind of reminded me of Ocarina of Time. This begs the question, why was DS1 the only game that had this? Dark Souls 2 was all kinds of â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. They had a poison gas swamp below a volcanic dungeon, a castle that just leads into a dragon's den (how convinent), and the DLC doesn't explain how you get there. You kind of just warp. Plus the DLC is even cheaper than the base game. But that's irrelivant to the point. - Difficulty. Maybe it's playing and finishing all the Souls games, but this game was damn easy. No, not in the way Gwyn is supposed to be, I mean beating the abyss watchers on the second try, before any guides were even out for the game, in a blind run. Why is High Lord Wolnir, arguably one of the coolest â¥â¥â¥â¥ing souls bosses ever, easier than the Capra Demon, a boss an hour into the first game??? The ancient dragon, pre-patch, was one of the hardest Souls bosses in DS2.  In this game, you kill a dragon with a plunge attack. A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PLUNGE ATTACK??? The only bosses I raged on was nameless king, because the camera was glitching out, an issue quickly fixed by fromsoft. The final boss whooped myâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥too for about a dozen deaths or so. I didn't really rage at that though persay, it was actually the classic DS great feeling of being killed, but learning something each time about the boss' move set. Overall, Dark Souls III is lacking in some aspects, but to me, it's almost as good as the first because of the music, art style, and hours of enjoyment and satisfaction it did give. If I had to make a list of best to worst, it would go like this; DS> BB > DS3> DS2> DemonsSouls > DS2SOFS"

        "Comments": "Posted: February 19, 2018              Your role within the world now serves a different purpose, the map design has your character initially descending into the depths of the world instead of ascending higher. Non-player character roles are subverted with initially kind, friendly characters not quite what they seem. From the start, Dark Souls 3 is all about lulling you into a false sense of security.This is carried through in the way the maps are designed. Initial areas are fairly straightforward to walk through, and the game kicks off relatively linear, with your character warping from a Demonâs Souls-like hub. However, once you venture from the simplicity and ease of the first few areas, the game starts to branch out with unprecedented depth and complexity.While Dark Souls 3âs changes in map design and difficulty spikes play with your expectations, the boss phase system in some fights seem incredibly unfair. In the latter portions of the game, the difficulty in some bosses stops coming from pattern recognition and instead from regenerating health and resurrections. Thankfully this is limited to just a few bosses in the game rather than the majority, which are brilliantly designed. While the original Dark Souls remains a legendary game, Dark Souls 3 is a worthy successor to the name.THE GOOD- Rich lore- Excellent exploration- Rewarding challenge- Great level design- Thrilling combatTHE BAD- Framerate- Inconsistent lock-on9/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

        "Comments": "Posted: December 12, 2018              I don't even know where to begin with this game, but of course I recommend it. Fromsoft's most recent addition to the Dark Souls series carries over the high standard of visuals and amplifies it tenfold, this game looks gorgeous. It was an absolute blast traversing each of the environments, and I liked how most enemies thematically match with the locales they are placed in. The bosses in this game are some of my favourite out of the whole series, from the elegance of the Dancer to the aggression of Sullyvahn, every moment was filled with a tense urgency, even some of the easier bosses hold a potent threat if you happen to misstep. The game maintains the unforgiving-yet-not-unfair nature to the gameplay, it still provides a good challenge for veteran players, however, streamlined mechanics and simplified navigation make it a good way for new players to ease their way in to the series. On the subject of the mechanics, you can tell that the game took some cues from Bloodborne, DS3's combat feels pretty fast paced compared to the other Souls games, mind you, it's still wrong to have a blatant disregard for strategic engagement. The faster pace could just be due to better optimisation and refined mechanics, whether it's a good thing or a bad thing is entirely subjective, some people prefer the clunky charm of the first DS and that's fine. Be sure to get your summon sign placed down and ember yourself up cos this game is really fun with friends, cooperative play is beneficial for both easing difficulty and farming souls, as well as sharing insight with players that might not know a lot about the games hidden intricacies. My favourite part of this game as with every other FromSoft Souls game is the delivery of the lore through item descriptions, inscriptions within the environments and employment of show-don't-tell methods, and the mellow yet empowering orchestra makes for a fitting soundtrack to accompany your entire journey. Last good thing I wanna mention is the more streamlined navigation of the menus, makes it easier than ever for those true to the Fashion-Souls way to navigate all the gear you'll end up acquiring. Whilst I have a lot of good things to say about the game, I don't wanna be positively biased, so here are some things I personally didn't like. The combat could be a put-off to those who prefer DS1 due to the less authentically sluggish feel, like I said, this game took more cues from Bloodborne, giving the character a separate levelling branch for equip-load also seemed a little unecessary. Another hit-or-miss feature is the abundance of fanservice, whilst it's fun for the vets to see returning mechanics and NPCs/enemies, it did start to feel a little distracting at times, but this is another entirely subjective critique.  The only other qualms I had was the less intricate connection of each part of the world, sections of each area felt a lot more linear and was more about creating loops than actually weaving each zone together (it's massively outshined by the interconnection of DS1), my last qualm is that some of the NPC side quests were a little too obscure, so those going for a completion run should beware, whilst I'd usually advise against guides, if you think you've missed major points in a characters quest then it wouldn't hurt to look up a walkthrough since some of the requirements are pretty damn easy to miss out on. Overall, I had a lot of fun, playing through with my friend, discovering all the optional areas and bosses which despite having the choice of skipping them entirely still have a staggering amount of detail poured into them, it truly is incredible seeing the craftsmanship of the environments and tone. FromSoft, you did not disappoint. Now to dig my claws into the DLCs...*ENDGAME SPOILER, STOP READING NOW IF YOU WISH TO AVOID*The final boss being an emalgamation of the DS1 base classes with mechanics carried over from the first Chosen Undead in the form of the Soul Of Cinder was an incredible final boss to finish the series, and brings the whole story full-circle, having his second phase inherit the moveset of Gwyn, the final boss of the first Dark Souls, was a moving moment as the remastered theme kicked in, it was a brilliant end to a brilliant series and honestly I can't think of any way they could've made it better."

Yes the game is challenging at some times but not nearly as the  game journalists  portrays as. THE GAME IS FAIR. Combat, level design, graphics, music are great. Combat is based on block, dodge, light/heavey attack and magic. DS has multiple charecter classes with each having correspondence attributes that you can change few times. Dark Souls III has the best boss design after Dark souls I. DS always had the grim, dark, medival theme which I always liked. If you've come here for a walking or button smashing  simulator this game is not for you. You have to explore, fight and earn your ownâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥for yourself.DS franchise has a very subtle way of story telling and from the lore perspective this game is second to none. This game has the best looking armor sets and wepons. Every weapon has some special move set that requires certain attributes.Invading and duel is half the fun of DS. Few of the npc will give you side quest and these quests are not like  do it later  quests. These had to be done in a cartain way to get certain things/ending.And finally Thank you Dark Souls.Praise the sun and remember  Try tounge but hole"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 9, 2016              This game has too many issues. First off a main statue of the game,  poise  is missing so expect to get stunlocked by just about everything. Secondly the meta pvp of the game is absolute trash. Essentially if you do not spam, then you will be killed by someone who does. Granted this has been a reoccuring problem in the souls series, but without poise the issue is worse. The boss fights, with the exception of some two bosses or so, are terribly deigned. Character design has been watered down for beginners, with over powered starting classes. Other aspects of the game have been watered down as well, for example, there is a bountiful amount of bonefires. The most in any souls game actually. NPC's are forgettable, as well as their questlines. The lore behind this game seems to be the weakest and most obserd in the series. Leveling up is a pain as the only way to level up is to go to the firekeeper, similar to Dark Souls 2. There is an obserd amount of hackers that will edit your profile and get you banned. Way too many issues for a game to be called complete, and should have been fixed prior to. I am an avid From Sotware fan, but their recent titles have seriously changed my mind. It's a terrible ending to an amazing series."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 9, 2016              Dark Souls 3 is pretty cool, I guess.You play as an Ashen One, a champion destined to defeat the lords of Cinder and link the first flame, a sort of beacon that keeps the light in the world while at the same time keeping the darkness at bay.I think.After beating up a large man with a coiled sword in his stomach and a very angry tape worm living inside him, you find yourself in a temple called the Firelink Shrine, which is looked after by this cute lady that has a very long list of chores for you to complete while you're out. The Firelink works as your home of sorts, it's the generally safest place and all of your friends live there. But it doesn't have a couch or broadband internet, you could probably sit in one of those giant chairs that one of the lords of Cinder used to sit in, I guess. I can't really go into much detail about the plot without spoiling a lot of things, so instead I will dance around talking about it like I'm playing the floor the lava. Dink Rolls 3, like it's predecessors, is an action RPG in the same vain of games like Blade of Darkness and Crusader: Might and Magic. While making your character, there are a multitude of options outside of just making them look like Gargamel from the Smurfs. You can choose where this character comes from, which doesn't do anything but change the general back story and appearance, but you also get to pick a starting class. In the long run, and much like a communist state, class doesn't really matter, but it can be used to give a head start to whatever stats you actually want to level up during the course of the game.Combat handles almost like two mustached gentleman having a boxing match, unless you're fighting one of the many monsters that lie in wait, in which case in turns into you hoping that it doesn't try to eat you with its horrific chest mouth. Your characters left and right arm are assigned by default to the triggers or bumpers on your controller or to your mouse. You can also lock on to your enemy so you can strafe around them and you don't end up being smooshed because your shield just so happened to be pointing the wrong way. There is a surprising amount of diversity to the combat, you can play as a shield bearing knight or SHOTGUN WIZARD to be sure, but the equipment and stats really help how you shape your play style. You can just go it as a knight or mage, sure, but weapons are assigned to your hands rather than your character itself like other RPGs. Putting a staff or a charm in one hand and a sword in the other will allow you to cast spells as well as whack anything that gets too close, just like using a shield in both hands will let you block doorways for others and giggle at them like the massive jerk you are. Drake Souls 3: Hotline Bling also has this neat online feature like it did in the other Souls games. Others playing the game can leave messages that can warn, inform, or screw with others. The game will also leave blood stains on the ground to show you where other chumps had died so you can either avoid the danger or stand in amazement at how some people can get killed in this game. But most prominent, and arguably most important, is the coop and PVP features in the game. While embered, which is this games equivalent of having humanity, you can find summon signs on the ground that allows you to summon others into your game. This other players will help you defeat the area and it's boss in return for an ember upon success. Or more than likely they'll be killed in your place so you can trek on while they make a splat on the floor. Kind of like a Loony Toons episode.  But maybe you aren't going to be a helpful little ghost that beats up monsters for others. Maybe you want to be... THE BAD GUY! Throughout the game you can find these little red orbs, or one big infinite red orb if you do something for someone. These red orbs allow you to invade other peoples world as a red phantom. As a red phantom, you must kill the host player in return for a few rewards. You don't even have to kill him yourself, actually, you can just have the world do it for you. Though be warned, because that can backfire through another of the games items I'll leave for your to discover. All these online features really work to enhance the general experience of the game. It makes the lonely journey not feel so lonely now that you know there are others on the same crusade as you are. It can also work as a motivator showing you that it's not as hard as you thought if others could do it. There are also these groups in the game you can join called Covenants, which work as a sort of guild system for the online community. Each Covenant has their own thing going on as well as their own goals.The world of Dan Souls 3 is fairly large and expansive in it's own way. While the world of Dark souls 1 was like a ball where everything is connected, the world of Dark Souls 3 is more like a branch, with a main road that breaks off into a plethora of curious locations. There's always this sense of wonder and treachery when you embark on a new quest through a dangerous area, something that the second game seemed to lack since none of the areas didn't seem all that connected. Like how the top of a windmill led straight to hell. Getting immersed into Dark Souls 3 almost makes you feel like a Witcher, if that makes sense. While you can just go through the game and reach the end, there is a lot of reward for exploring and finding secret areas and dungeons that you may have not had to visit during your journey. You learn about the world around you by paying attention and scrounging for lore through various NPCs and items you obtain along the way. The items and equipment you pick up each have a description ranging from just the use of the item itself to the origin and history of the character it may or may not be related to.  They don't seem all that important, but sooner or later things begin to click and you start to understand the world around you a little bit more. The boss battles is where Dark Souls 3 really shines, some of them are lame, sure, but most of them feel like a climatic end or halfway point of your expedition into a dungeon or a cave or a castle or whatever. Bosses are fast, vicious, and hit hard, forcing you to think on your feet. They challenge your reflexes and decision making skills and you feel like a true hero when you manage to make a boss look like a fool by dodging all of their flashy and powerful attacks.BUTShould you play Don King Souls 3: Screwing Mike Tyson? It stands as a nice end to a series. As much as I would prefer if From was known for their games about robots dashing at one another aggressively, I can see how Dark Souls became their most venerated series. It's a game that I can see pulling people into the series and making them interested in the previous games in the series. Is it crushingly difficult as some people make it out to be? No, but it's challenging, it expects a certain amount of competency from the player and doesn't want to just hand things to you. Its kind of lame to see articles and videos floating about on the internet of people who's entire job revolves around playing video games wishing that the game had a easy mode just because they were unwilling to learn and adapt to the games mechanics. Which is why you should listen to me, Dirk.Dark Souls 3 is the kind of game that expects you to actually sit down and play the game, be engulfed in it's dark and foreboding world, learn and connect the pieces that make up it's lore. Is it the best RPG ever made? No, and if you didn't like the other games in the series, I doubt you'd like this one. But is it a fantastic game? Definitely. Dark Souls 3 gets 5 heavily armored camping trips out of 5 and the Dirk Dickbutt stolen Oscar award of approval."

Its almost as good as Dark Souls 1, which i consider to be the best game with the souls formula (including Bloodborne). PvP was a damn blast this time around. A+++ and A MUST BUY.Now bring on the DLC and hopefully it will be as awesome as Artorias of Abyss / Old Hunters."

Timing your blocks, parries, rolls, etc. is your key to victory. As well as being constantly aware of your surroudings as death lurks at you every corner. It also has a very unique atmosphere I've ever seen in games before and it's cool. The characters, the creatures you encounter, the boss fights, soundtrack,etc. It's a phenomenal game and to me I felt confident in playing through it after defeating the 1st boss. It just gives you satisfaction defeating large enemies for souls.I would definitely reccommend Dark Souls III whether you are a veteran (you probably have it already anyway) or new to the series like me."

Downloaded the game, set up my stream and got all my viewers excited to watch the game, then about 1.5 hrs in, after the first boss fight, the game crashed. I chalked it up to my PC juggling too many things at once. Fired up the game again, and non-stop crashing. People say put  lighting  on  low . I've had all my settings on  low . Still crashes.  People say  play as the knight  as they say it doesn't crash. For me, still crashes my game. Even crashes when the only thing I'm running is the game, so it's not my stream setup.It's appalling that such a triple A title game would be this buggy at launch. Get your sh!t together FromSoftware/Bandai Namco!I would change this review to positive if I could actually play the game."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 5, 2017              I now put around 100 hours into this game and I can definetly recommend it. Long story short:+ graphics are really good. Most if not all locations look beautiful. The developers paid a lot of attention to details.+ sound is great and  realistic . Dark Souls 3 features by far the best soundtrack in the series. The theme of the Abyss Watchers is a prime example. The voice acting is also pretty good. + combat is fluid and faster as in Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2.+ a lot of armour, weapons, spells, miracles and pyromancies. + great multiplayer - yeah, it is basically the same as in 1 and 2 but this kind of multiplayer is unique compared to any other franchise (I include Demon's Souls and Bloodborne into the Souls franchise).+ really good quests which enrich the story and are not thrown into your face like in any other RPG.+ really good length. Doesn't matter if you include the DLC or not.- invasions or PVP in general can be annoying due to latency issues or lag. Only the arena (accessable while playing the DLC) features a server. The rest is P2P.- backtracking for additional armour doesn't make much sense - discover location A, 5 hours later, at location X, you kill a certrain unique enemy, armour can now be found at location A. I'm talking about Havel's armour to be specific.- the first DLC, Ashes of Ariandel, is pretty poor on it's own when it comes to length and variety. But since anybody who buys the game probably buys the complete edition anyway, this does not mean much. I just wanted to point that out. Especially since both DLC's belong together - literally. - some enemy types can be seen as a recycled version of an earlier enemy later on. It is not that obvious as in other games but still. Seems kinda lazy.I can definetly recommend the purchase of this game. It does not matter if it is on sale or not. In my opinion, it still is worth 60 bucks. Compare it to  triple A  trash from Activision or EA and you can pay 100â¬ without batting an eye."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 23, 2016              Dark Souls 3 is a pretty good, but certainly not great ending to the Souls series. Playing this game I never did got the same great vibe I got from Dark Souls 1 & 2. Some of the bosses on the game or nothing short of disappointing, the questlines to some characters have little payoff (though some are great), and the game leans very heavily on past nostalgia from Dark Souls 1, with improved combat mechanics.     Buuut.. Did I hate this game? Oh no. I loved it. It is a Souls game still, true and true. The lore is amazing, and still found through gameplay and not cutscenes. Combat is faster than ever, there are even more amazing boss weapons, and some areas are larger than before.  But there are aspects of it that will frustrate you.Pros: -Faster combat, and maneuverability -Some areas are definitely longer... -Still has the good old Souls feel -Lore is given to the interested players through very optional ways -PvP funner than ever -Co-op with friends is easier, with a password that allows you to summon only those with the same password Cons:-Wether the new weapon skill system was neccessary, is subjective. -Some areas are definitely longer... but there are fewer of them and some are very very annoying. -Summoning is sometimes a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as it fails if you summon more than 1 phantom simultaneously. -End bosses are mostly disappointing.. -A lot of unwarranted nostalgia from DS1 holds this game up -Seems a little too easy for some."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 14, 2016              Arguably the best Souls game in the series. Takes all the great things that made the previous Souls games great, and carried on some of the improvements set by Bloodborne like tighter controls and combat mechanics. The visuals are extremely beautiful. Imagine the familiar artistic design of the first Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, but running on a brand new shiny engine focused on current gen systems. The draw distance and shadows have been improved significantly, and the geometry and textures are all nicely detailed. Every time you get to a new area is a breathtaking experience.It's also the most accessible game From Software has made so far. Though this doesn't mean it's any less challenging, it just has more mechanics and failsafes to make for a less tedious experience like bonfires being more spread apart generously, co-op and summoning being more streamlined, progression between levels are a bit more linear, and a more convenient central hub. There are also things like the ability to change your character appearance on an existing save file via an NPC, various rings affect some aethestic changes so you can tailor fit your character better, and subtle changes like your attacks don't track dodging players anymore.The music and sound design is awesome as usual, with some familiar call backs as well for series veterans. Some specific improvements on the PC version for one is that they finally fixed the game logic, which means 60fps doesn't affect the meta of the game anymore, so players who play 30fps or 60fps have the same consistent gameplay. While there's been a lot of people getting unfortunate crashes and other technical issues, this is still perhaps the best port of a Souls game on the PC yet. Since Miyazaki intended this to be finale of the series, From Software really dished everything out for this game, with some few nods and fan service for fans of the previous games, and has some of the best boss fights in the series. The variety of boss types are considerably better than the previous games, with just the first boss alone for the tutorial stage being perhaps the most intense first boss yet in the series. All the designs are very memorable, and each phase on all of the boss fights are an intense rush.Whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer, Dark Souls III is definitely worth playing, and once all the bugs are ironed out it's a definite contender for GOTY already."

But instead the game is just littered with references to the other games, which would be fine if it was done in moderation. Also the overall linearity of the game and lack of viable build variety is going to ruin replayability. The only reason you'd have to replay the game would be to attempt completing the finicky  quests  which are so asinine that there's almost no point other than achievement hunting. If you're desperate for more Souls, I suppose you might enjoy this a little bit."

Now I've always been a big fan of monster hunter so when I saw the main character run around in 3rd person perspective, wielding an enormous demon killing sword, I just had to get my finger in it. Even though it wasn't clear whether it would even release in the EU.Two games followed which indeed was memorable, but still was lacking something.Then this finally came along. The third and supposedly final installation of the series.There is something here for new players as well as for old. It's basically like if you combined all the four games into one.The thing I really love about this game is the atmosphere and if you're into gory, dark fantasy, worlds shrouded in fog with bosses way stronger than you then this is the game for you.Just be prepared to die... a lot. :)"

It was this point in the game i realised that i didnt care if  i beat him because i was summoned into my friends world and it meant more to him than me so instead i just caved my skull in and threw my pc out my window and finally i was in peace... like i could just die in peace go to heaven but realise heaven doesnt exist so i went back to the wolnir boss arena and i will forever get fisted by his gassy juice getting poured into  my blood stream and poured into my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. at this point i realised i only had to break his stupid gucci bracelets made by â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lil pump i then easily killed him and killed myself. best game 10/10 i just wish i could fight High lord wolnir for the rest of my puny existance on this god forsaken planet(I have like 600 hours on dark souls 3 and like 500 on dark souls 1 on console so this review is the most valid thing you will ever read about a game ever)"

Com'on !! This is a severe offence for both the games. Yes, Indeed! Alright well basically this is how you become a fan of souls series. When youâve no idea or whatsoever to do as youâve finished all your other games, suddenly you hear people saying OMG Dark Souls is the hardest game ever bla bla. Then you watch a video, make your decision and buy the game. You start the game with terrifying music to play and keep getting yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥beaten over and over and over and over and over x10000 times again. Ah then you finally beat your tutorial first boss and feel the glory, power and feel the REAL satisfaction which youâve never felt before! Now you take a break and watch videos, wiki etc and get to know Dark Souls Story and youâre like what the hell? This game has so much deep story, holy crap and then you dig deep into the story!!  then you shed some tears when you get to know about Knight Artorias and his Puppy Sif. I also think Nameless king and his Dragon has some special bond too. Every Single Bosses, Mini Bosses, Corrupted and EVEN EVERY DAMN BRICKS has their own emotional story :(  but someone will always remain close to us, It's Solaire of Astora or simply its the SUN BRO!! He is here to find his own sun! and then then then you just start to hear the soundtracks, animations, parody etc and thatâs how you become Dark Soulâs Ultimate fan!Git Gud or Die Trying"

Many will buy this game not fully getting that's basically a hardcore game, pretty much old school in the way that is meant to reward you for your hard efford, the game have 1 set difficulty and you will have to struggle, maybe coop with friends and try countless times until you get the grip of it, eventually you'll understand the mechanic of the game and you will die in ocations but in the end this is a really amazing journey within a story that i still don't fully understand, before i forget this is an Action RPG game, third person and for new ppl this is NOT something to take it lightly.First steps: At first when you start to understand what's an unkindled, a hallow, a lord of cinder, you will start playing a souls game, you will admire beautiful landscapes, amazing scenes while playing and cutscenes that are really well made until you get frustrated by being killed by any single enemy alone in the game, yet with perseverance comes strenght, you will succed if you keep trying, you will see the amazing many places this game have (tho linear, really restricted) and the amazing bosses and INCREDIBLE soundtrack, the gameplay for me was made to use a controller rather that the keyboard but that's up to you and one final thing, optimization has been done really good but the game's frames drops sometimes so it would be nice a patch to adress those issues.Final note: i have so much to say about the souls games and this one in particular, i might update this review later, for me this game it's a bit expensive at the moment but if you're looking for a challange then this is a great game. I'm happy i've got this one.Metascore: 82/100  Give it a try, if you don't mind losing your souls, unkindled one :)"

It is definitely much harder than the other souls games, in my opinion. The artstyle is very beautiful as well!"

Many areas have beautiful vistas allowing you to take in the entire world and see many locations you previously visited, making you feel like you are part of something larger. + The level design is some of the best I have seen in a Dark Souls game. Every area feels amazing to explore and unlocking new shortcuts always feels satisfying.+ Every area has a very distinct atmosphere and level design. You can go from navigating deadly swamps to tight filled corridors and it all feels natural.   + Combat has been altered. Things feel a bit faster than other Dark Souls games. I also found rolling to be more effective at dodging attacks than previous titles. + Multiple way of developing your character. + Boss battles look amazing and require real strategy and skill to take down. The Average:+/- A minor gripe I have are bonfire placements are placed too close together. Bonfireâs in Dark Souls has always been a sense of relief, a place to regroup and go out and face new dangers. In this game I felt like I was running into a bonfire much more often than usual. The Bad:- NPC quest lines play a more prominent role, yet many of them require very specific things to do, and if you advance far into the game without completing a previous requirement you end up missing out. Even after reading a walkthrough, I thought to myself âHow is anybody suppose to figure this out on their own?â - Once again UI can be really improved upon. You would expect the third game would fix some of these issues. - No pause button  Conclusion:Easily my favorite Dark Souls game. Overall level design and mechanics seem to be refined and improved upon in most ways. I am not sure if Iâm just getting better at these types of games or they are making things easier, either way Dark Soul games have become one of my favorite franchises."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 11, 2016              Im going to start off by saying this is a review of the games PvP/PvE aspect and the feedback the community has gotten from Fromsoft. If you are only playing this game for the story and are not interested in any of the semantics than I whole heartedly recommend this game to you.Going to start off with a series of pros and cons.-PROS--Gameplay is very fast paced and fluid, I have never had a problem with my movement being stunted or interrupted at all-Weapons are very diverse and there are alot of choices this time around, albeit a bit less than Dark Souls 2-Every weapon has a very satisfying moveset that really feels like the hits impact and connect-Enemies are very memorable and so is every bossfight-The levels are very diverse and the final boss was the best boss I have probably ever fought in a videogame.Now here comes the cons.-CONS--Incredibly vague patch notes that literally say nothing in terms of information, ie  Performance adjustment for Greatsword  what did you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing adjust???-Magic requires a huge stat investment to even consider being viable, Im talking 40-60+ Int/Faith to even START doing any type of damage, and even then the spell  Farron Dart  doesnt even 1 shot the starting enemies, it takes TWO. And not to mention that anyone with half a brain can dodge a spell in PvP.-Straightswords are literally the best weapons in the game, there is no point in even using anything else because anything other than a rapier or a straightsword is a complete waste of time and effort because unless you are incredibly consistent at parrying you will ALWAYS get R1 spammed down.-Invasions are also a complete waste of time considering that Estus is virtually unpunishable unless you keep CONSTANT pressure, the host has 30% more hp and TWICE the Estus flasks and literally infinite phantoms (Coop players) to summon and just wittle you down until you finally die, and at that point if you do somehow manage to kill all of them, the host will just disconnect. Not to mention that you can't even use the games enemies to your advantage because Seeds of a Giant Tree (Items that turn enemies hostile to invaders, they normally are not) are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing easy to get.-Poise is completely non existant, allowing someone who is wearing a greatshield and the heaviest armor in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game to get staggered by an enemy with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dagger, when Fromsoft was asked about this, all they had to say was, âThe poise stat is working as intended and is not âturned offâ as some fans have theorized,â a spokesperson for Bandai Namco told me. âThe stat works differently than in past games and is more situational, which seems to be the reason for the confusion.â Even though the stat is literally DISABLED in the games code.-Straightswords have literally twice the hitbox than the visual length, and can hit you from what seems like 10 feet away when they are clearly swinging at the air. And no, Im not talking about phantom range, Im literally talking about the hitbox. Outranging even some Ultra Greatswords in length.In short, fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game FromSoft."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 28, 2016              After Spending a few months playing this game i have come to many different conclusions. I love this game!It's beautiful and gob-smacking, the animations are fluid and quick. Areas are challenging if you don't know what you are doing and its brilliant, i just simply cannot get enough of this game. The boss's are memorable, so are the areas which  you can explore, the voice acting is amazing and the music, it's an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the ears. It's an absolute breathtaking game and i love it.Although it may be an epic game and awesome to play, i do have some concerns...My problem is invasions, and i know, i know, you're going to say  Pvp isn't suppose to be fair.  and all that crap but there are genuine problems that a majority of you will agree on, I have some ideas on how it should be.The whole point of invasions are suppose to be fun and enjoyable, but it's facing more then 2-3 people if you're the invader, okay, i can agree with that if you are desperate for help but really that many people is simply not needed, at all, the whole point of the invasion system should be to enhance the difficulty for said host, with 2-3+ people, where is the challenge? The souls series are based off challenging difficulty and with that many people there might as well be an  easy mode ... or even a  Beginner mode When you, the invader are faced up with them people with 3+ phantom, you got no backup you may as well crystal out. Not only that but all the people at said area and they just linger around the bonfire, with your 2-4 bodyguards with their heads up the hostsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Overall i can forgive all that, that's right, Invasions ain't suppose to be fair, and you should have to fight at least the host +1, maybe +2  phantom('s) (If you can play smart.), BUT, (Now this is what really gets to me!). If you kill the phantoms, the host has the power to summon them an unlimited amount of times and chooses not to fight you at all without a helper, which is unbelieveably stupid, and down right pethetic, It's really bad game design, expecialy when the host is 1) A higher level then you. 2) Has more heals then you. 3) Way more better then you at Pvp 4) has 30% more health then you. It renders the invasion system completely useless and not fun at all. DarkSouls2 was more forgiving in this matter, if that phantom died, you COULD NOT summon that same guy again untill either you died or you rested at the bonfire, yeah sure it resetted the NPC's but that was but a small price to pay for the back up you needed, and looking back, i loved that feature. Back to DarkSouls3, this time the wolf covinant, and the aldrich covinant, they are awesome don't get me wrong, but when im playing solo trying to make my way through (This has happened to me loads of times.) i get 2-3 watchdogs or aldrich faithful invade me, when you say  Invasions ain't suppose to be fair  you actualy being a hypocrite. Oh the Irony. The point of invasions is to have fun and really, it's not... In DarkSouls2 there was always the suspence of the possiblility to be invaded, you were always on edge and alert, and you needed to be prepared and DarkSouls3 takes that brilliant, brilliant mechanic, and takes aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on it, then proceeds to smother thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥over it's face while laughing histericaly...Overall It's a fantastic game and beautiful, it's an absolute thumbs up for me, it's not perfect but with certain fix's, it's really has the potential to be perfect. I can almost taste how perfect it would be if the invasion system wasn't as flawed."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 23, 2016              I figured my original review, which just stated  Dope and dank , needed an update. To put it simply, This game is a masterpiece. Demon Souls and Dark Souls are both fantastic games, but are quite dated, especially gameplay-wise, with their four-directional rolling. Dark Souls II is a pretty good game, my first Dark Souls game, and it improved upon Dark Souls in many ways, but was still worse than its predecesor. I have yet to beat Bloodborne, but I love it's atmosphere and it has a lot in common with Dark Souls III in terms of gameplay. Dark Souls III mastered combat in the Souls franchise. PvP feels extremely fluent and skill-based most of the time. The bosses are creative and fighting them doesn't feel like a chore, unless you get stuck, in which case, there's no harm in getting help from a phantom. Normal enemies feel pleasant to fight, they're put in okay places and when there's way too many, there's usually another way to deal with them.The visuals are incredible, the effects, enemies, and NPC's all come to life in Lothric, the fantasy world the game is set in. The bosses all have a menacing atmosphere, even  The Deacons of the Deep  which is jokingly easy, even if it was just a normal enemy.The DLC is nothing to complain about, it adds to the game and it is definitely worth the purchase.The soundtrack is one of the few video game soundtracks I listen to outside of the game, it's wonderful. It adds to the atmosphere incredibly well, and there's not a single song in the game that seems out of place.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, I feel like it's a modern classic, and it almost never feels boring. My only gripes are that the anti-cheat system is awful, it's somewhat short (but it doesn't bother me too much, as its replayablity value is off the charts)."

The level design is very comparable to Dark Souls1 but isn't overkill like Dark Souls 2.The bosses and the enemies are more fast paced comparable to Bloodborne fighting which is great.PVP is soooo easy in this and I love it.  At Pontiff there is so many people invading and hosting it is basically like a built in fight club now.  No more waiting in a forest or old boring battle systems that dont work haha.  Overally I have beat the game a few times now and plan to keep playing for a while.  It is unfortunate that this is the last Dark Souls.  RIP"

I started playing the series on PS3 (demon souls) and i never finished it as I was still scrub at that time and had no idea WTF IS THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT. I returned to the series with dark souls 2 and to be honest I liked it. Someone once told me Dark souls was superior so I borrowed the game and gave it a shot. and I liked both.Now we have the third and final game of the series, and gosh it is amazing. I was so excited for the game that it reallyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off when certain people get to play 3 weeks earlier, and items location starts to pop up on the net. Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I could but well, internet is the internet. But at least there wasnt much spoilers after Abyss Watchers since there was an embargo. Which is nice..ish Still sucked that you couldnt play till 3 weeks later.  Now to the actual gameplayIt plays wonderfully on my GTX 970. No random crashed. Combat is fun. I'd say its a combo between bloodborne style with dark souls 1. A lot of weapons to choose from. So all builds are viable builds. Except estoc.. causeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥estoc.. pffff ConsHackers... well we know this would happen on any PC game. Sigh. \\I'd give this game a solid 9.5/10. I take 0.5 away cause there's 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING POISON SWAMP AREA. Its like miyazaki just go and like.. hey you know what would be better than 1 poisonous swamp area? 3 POISONOUS SWAMP AREA. Blurgh."

Soul Level Matchmaking is back, with an anti-twink measure (weapon reinforcement). Multiplayer is made way easier with password matchmaking too. (Thank goodness Soul Memory is gone.)The characters, lore, questlines, bosses are quite a massive improvement from DS1 and especially DS2, with all bosses having at least 2 phases and interesting backstories. Weapon movesets are rather varied, especially with the introduction of Battle Arts. Armor upgrades are gone but that means more Fashion Souls! It's also very nice to see customization options improved such as Character Creation and Optional Manual Attack Aiming.They should really work on the Poise system though, as stunlocking by Estocs and Straight Swords (Dark Sword) is... is... sigh. Phantom range is not as bad as DS2, but it happens sometimes due to bad connections on top of weapons like estoc and katanas. As for fanservice, of course there will be, but it is acceptable. (cough cough DS2 Old Dragonslayer cough cough)However, one thing that must be fixed in the softban issue. Many players falsely flagged as hacking/cheating, restricting online play. Luckily, it seems that the devs/publishers are actually doing something about it, albeit slow. All in all, Dark Souls 3 is a game well worth its asking price. Even new players to the franchise should pick it up if they can as it will provide them an exprience no other game can ever give. To players struggling with the game, I have this to say,  Don't give up, skeleton!"

Mechanically, Dark souls 3 is best in show for me, with an excellent middleground between the original, and the most recent Miyazaki game, Bloodborne.Absolutely worth playing for every build, every item, and every boss fight."

This game is great in the pve aspect but after about 300-500 hours the pve will get mundane and seem pointless because you know you can complete the game easily. The problem I have is the pvp. The classes are not balanced, and the only meta is straight swords with pyromancys and the occasional switch up. I loved pvp at first, but once i started to fight good players I soon realized that sorcerers and clerics had no place for it. Melee and pyromancy is the only way to go which is fine for  a while but soon its gets boring and you crave more classes to fight competitvly with.One gripe of mine is that invastions dont work out half the time because these literalâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥just hit F5 out of the game and you get disconnected. Im still going to thumbs this game up because I dont want casual players to scroll through the reviews and see a downvote just because I dont like pvp."

It's better than the games I played last year too - and it managed to pull me away from Overwatch for basically 3 weeks straight, and I'm still not finished with it, even after 280+ hours.Very highly recommended, even for newcomers to the series. In fact,  especially  for newcomers to the series, as this game is probably your best way in to what is most definitely one of the best damn game series ever created.Long(er) version:Dark Souls 3 is the first Souls game I played that I actually enjoyed - I own Dark Souls 1 & 2, and neither of those immediately grabbed me like Dark Souls 3 did. I didn't have to try nearly as hard to start enjoying DS3 as I did the other two games in the series.Because of this, if you are a newcomer to the Souls series, I would highly recommend you play this game first to get a feel for the controls and playstyle of the game, then after completing it, go back and play the older games, which is what I am doing now.As for DS3 itself, I haven't played a game this captivating, both inside and outside the game, in years. The last time a game occupied my everyday thoughts this much was many years ago, back on my old PS3 days with Battlefield 3. I played DS3 for a couple of hours to begin with, and made fair progress. But - the moment I beat the 1st real boss you face, after the  tutorial  boss, I was hooked.Every time I put my controller down I was immediately thinking what I was going to do next when I played again. I put 60 hours into this game in my first 2 weeks of owning it - whilst also working full time. Like I said, I haven't played a game that captured me this much in years.The combat system is intuitive, fluid and feels fantastic to play at 60fps. The hitboxes are awesome - a simple search on youtube will reveal to you just how good they are. The rolling thresholds are gone from the old games, so now you can  fast  roll at 70% equpid load, rather than the 16% from Dark Souls 1.The graphics are fantastic and very well themed - playing on an Nvidia 770 4GB I can run this game at a solid 60 on high. Walking through one of the later areas of the game that is lit with moonlight looks stunning - you'll know which area I mean when you get there!The story continues from the previous 2 games, and is as deep and fascinating as ever. You can skip the story completely, by not reading item descriptions and skipping the NPC dialogue. But, if you pay attention and spend some time every now and again reading a few things, you'll quickly become immersed in this game (and series') amazingly deep and thorough story. If anything, I recommend you play the older games just to learn the origins of the some of the bosses and items you find in this game. If not, there are many lore videos on youtube, all worth a watch.The PvP is... Well, its Dark Souls, so very competitive and sometimes kinda toxic. There is an established meta Soul Level you can stop levelling once you reach - it is at this level you will experience the most varied and plentiful PvP. Invasions are broken, with the invader being at a huge disadvantage, but these can still be fun from time to time, if you get lucky and invade a good host. If you're looking for good, fair PvP, look up honour duels for this game and try some summoning rather than invading - I enjoy honor duels substantially more than invasions, but it all comes down to what type of a PvP experience you are looking for. Poise is  broken    working as intended  , so be careful when using super slow weapons in PvP as enemies with faster weapons will very easily stagger you and get you in a stun lock - not fun at all.The weapons are varied enough to keep you busy for a long time, if you want to learn and use each. Some weapons that were very good from previous games have been completely borked, but there are many other awesome alternatives you can use that are equally as fun. The armor is good with many blast-from-the-pasts from previous games, allowing you to cosplay as your favourite bosses or make some hideous monstrosity wearing only a loincloth giant fat armor.Character creation and customisation is also improved from previous games, allowing you to tweak your character to fairly deep measures. The music - oh man the music. Give the composer a Grammy, please. The boss fights in this game are awesome as they are (well, most anyway..), but the music really takes them to the next level. The music in the forefront of my mind is the track that accompanies the first Lord of Cinder you fight, but all of the tracks are amazing in their own right and perfectly accompany an already fantastic game.Overall, this game is honestly the best game I've played this year. It's better than the games I played last year too - and it managed to pull me away from Overwatch for basically 3 weeks straight.Very highly recommended, even for newcomers to the series. In fact,  especially  for newcomers to the series, as this game is your best way in to what is probably one of the best damn game series ever created."

Very nice graphics,tough boss fights and,compared to the other ones,nice gameplay and actually feels very good with no delay (which was a big problem in DS I + DS II imo). I recommend playing this game if you're into hard games! (You can also smash bosses with your friends which is a nice feature but I wouldn't recommend that because the fights get pretty easy by summoning others and that neutralizes the idea of the game)"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 31, 2016              It's pretty neat, although I wouldn't consider it the best entry in the Souls games. I'm just going to list things that I enjoyed and things that I thought were done better in the previous games. So let's start with the graphics, which look very familiar if you played Bloodborne. It's definitely an upgrade to the previous Souls games and the locations are absolutely stunning so there is really nothing I could complain about in this departement. The combat is a bit faster now which is fine by me. There is also Weapons Art and the the addition of the Focus Points which I, as a UGS wielder never actually used. Perhaps it has its uses for some situations but I never encountered those. Poise is drastically changed now, I could wear full Havels and become staggered by some rat or a starved dog. I'm not sure what From was thinking when implemanting those changes. Other then that the PvE and PvP are very enjoyable and there are a lot more people to play with. The game difficulty swaps around a bit. For instance the only challenging area was Archdragon Peak for me. Maybe it's just me and after 3 games I already got used to the concept and gameplay so that's why I would consider Dark Souls 1 as the most challenging of them all. Game seems a lot shorter even for someone who has to  100% every area available .  Steam says that I spend aroung 120 hours on DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne yet I have  only  50 on DS3 and I almost finished it. All in all the game has it flaws here and there but in the end it's very enjoyable and something that I would recommend on buying to someone who enjoyed the previous games. It's also probably the best game to start with if you want to play the Soulsborne games as it seems a bit more beginner friendly.Oh, I forgot to say that the music is ridiculously good which is really worth mentioning."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 23, 2016              I figured my original review, which just stated  Dope and dank , needed an update. To put it simply, This game is a masterpiece. Demon Souls and Dark Souls are both fantastic games, but are quite dated, especially gameplay-wise, with their four-directional rolling. Dark Souls II is a pretty good game, my first Dark Souls game, and it improved upon Dark Souls in many ways, but was still worse than its predecesor. I have yet to beat Bloodborne, but I love it's atmosphere and it has a lot in common with Dark Souls III in terms of gameplay. Dark Souls III mastered combat in the Souls franchise. PvP feels extremely fluent and skill-based most of the time. The bosses are creative and fighting them doesn't feel like a chore, unless you get stuck, in which case, there's no harm in getting help from a phantom. Normal enemies feel pleasant to fight, they're put in okay places and when there's way too many, there's usually another way to deal with them.The visuals are incredible, the effects, enemies, and NPC's all come to life in Lothric, the fantasy world the game is set in. The bosses all have a menacing atmosphere, even  The Deacons of the Deep  which is jokingly easy, even if it was just a normal enemy.The DLC is nothing to complain about, it adds to the game and it is definitely worth the purchase.The soundtrack is one of the few video game soundtracks I listen to outside of the game, it's wonderful. It adds to the atmosphere incredibly well, and there's not a single song in the game that seems out of place.Overall, I give this game a 9.5/10, I feel like it's a modern classic, and it almost never feels boring. My only gripes are that the anti-cheat system is awful, it's somewhat short (but it doesn't bother me too much, as its replayablity value is off the charts)."

The level design is very comparable to Dark Souls1 but isn't overkill like Dark Souls 2.The bosses and the enemies are more fast paced comparable to Bloodborne fighting which is great.PVP is soooo easy in this and I love it.  At Pontiff there is so many people invading and hosting it is basically like a built in fight club now.  No more waiting in a forest or old boring battle systems that dont work haha.  Overally I have beat the game a few times now and plan to keep playing for a while.  It is unfortunate that this is the last Dark Souls.  RIP"

I started playing the series on PS3 (demon souls) and i never finished it as I was still scrub at that time and had no idea WTF IS THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT. I returned to the series with dark souls 2 and to be honest I liked it. Someone once told me Dark souls was superior so I borrowed the game and gave it a shot. and I liked both.Now we have the third and final game of the series, and gosh it is amazing. I was so excited for the game that it reallyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥me off when certain people get to play 3 weeks earlier, and items location starts to pop up on the net. Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I could but well, internet is the internet. But at least there wasnt much spoilers after Abyss Watchers since there was an embargo. Which is nice..ish Still sucked that you couldnt play till 3 weeks later.  Now to the actual gameplayIt plays wonderfully on my GTX 970. No random crashed. Combat is fun. I'd say its a combo between bloodborne style with dark souls 1. A lot of weapons to choose from. So all builds are viable builds. Except estoc.. causeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥estoc.. pffff ConsHackers... well we know this would happen on any PC game. Sigh. \\I'd give this game a solid 9.5/10. I take 0.5 away cause there's 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING POISON SWAMP AREA. Its like miyazaki just go and like.. hey you know what would be better than 1 poisonous swamp area? 3 POISONOUS SWAMP AREA. Blurgh."

I own all of the DLCs.The graphics are beautiful and dynamic. There is nothing else I can say about it because it's attractively appealing. I love the soundtrack and the dialogues. The characters have such great voices and I feel a connection as if I am included in the story. Many characters have different personalities and roles which adds color to the game's lore. The level design also plays a role in the game's lore because depending on your level it can impact your play style. For example, if you're weak you will obviously need to spend more interaction within the game to make yourself stronger. During this time you'll gather more information from different characters. You'll learn about the relationships of certain characters with other characters, you'll know about the history of the Lords of Cinders, the surroundings and find more objects and hidden areas.There are a variety of enemies some are easy and some can be a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ There are a great variety of items, armour and weapons to try. I believe the combat is better than the previous series because it's more polished and faster. You can create a build from 10 different characters. For example, you can be a warrior, a mage, pyromancer, thief, assassin etc. You can customize the appearance of your character and you can give him/her a name. There is an option where you can choose 1 start up gift for your character. I believe the strongest character to pick and build up is the Pyromancer because it makes sense to me as DS3 is all about the  flames . Most enemies in the game are weak against fire.The game is meant to be difficult, so play it with great patience and don't break your setup, just take a break. I believe it's easier and more comfortable to play with a controller because you can lie or sit on a couch. The game is also multiplayer and supports co-op, but it's not a mmorpg. You can join a covenant which adds more activites in the game. The matchmaking is dependent on the covenant you have. Some covenants are supportive towards co-op whereas some are for PVP. The co-op covenants are designed for players who have trouble fighting off invaders or bosses and the PVP convenants are designed for players who wants to invade a player's world.Some info about game performance:Running at.... 60fps in max settings with 1080p 60Hz IPSGTX 780 3GB GDDR5i7-2600K 8MB cache 3.4GHz with OC Genie 216GB DDR3 1333MHz RAMStored in HyperX Fury SSD with 500MBs r/w speedNoctua NH-D15 air cooler"

Hard  implies a great challenge and test of skill, power, and patience.  Harsh  implies accountability for our actions, that mistakes will be punished and good decisions will be rewarded. This game isn't hard, it's harsh. I've died plenty of times while playing and not a single one was because  I'm not good enough . Every time, there was a bad decision I made, a fight I picked badly or shouldn't have picked, a trap I handled badly, or a giant skeleton king I fought while emotionally compromised from work.Skill is a factor, skill is rewarded, but this is a game anyone can play and that anyone can conquer. This game has a lot of depth, lore, challenges and intrigue that make it a work of art in itself and in that regard it's nothing short of incredible. I highly recommend this game, it's very well made and executed, and it doesn't have that stupid mouse input delay the second has."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 12, 2016              Latest installment to the series. Unlike DARK SOULS II, this game directed by the creator itself, Hidetaka Miyazaki. As you can see, game resemblances with other Miyazaki games like Demon's Souls, Bloodborne and the original DARK SOULS.ComparissionsIf i need to give some examples, game speed is much like Bloodborne's, you have some gameplay elements from Demon's Souls like instead of counts of spells (which is implemented in DARK SOULS and DARK SOULS II) is gone and replaced by another bar that allows you to cast them, and game itself pretty look alike with DARK SOULS.DARK SOULS II has smooth animations, but in DARK SOULS III, they are gone and replaced with DARK SOULS ones, but improved. It's not a bad thing, but i want to mention that.My personally thoughts about this game, it's kinda feel Downgraded after DARK SOULS II. Why? I must admit that DARK SOULS II was good game, even it's not feels like it's predecessor, but somehow, it's evolved to another stage. It has nice elements like different covenant mechanics, new enemy placements on every Journey, expanded questlines...However, in DARK SOULS III everything gone simplier again. Covenants are pretty same of each other, questlines are too linear, there is only health and damage increase on new Journeys. It forgots everything that DARK SOULS II introducted. It pretty successor to DARK SOULS, not II. Probably Miyazaki wants to forgot the second game in series, because he wasn't directed it. He was busy with Bloodborne.Another thing is which bothers me a lot, this game has nice gestures, they have even looping. But hell, why did popular ones are missing?! Yeah, i am talking about Well! What is it! and Decapitate, why they are missing!Why can't we revive bosses? Hell, again, DARK SOULS II has this feature. It comes handy on lots of situations, like you want to get invades, revive the boss, and wait. It's simple as square.Last, but not least, poise. Poise is still in the game, but no one knows what it's for. Unlike his big brothers in this game, poise is replaced by Hyper Armour, which is only affects with big weapons.ThoughtsWell, i think i mentioned every possible comparision, so let's disscuss about game itself.Game wasn't balanced on it's first release, but developers are still trying to make game balanced. It's a nice thing because this game turns 1 year old and they still support it.Invading system, which is a core mechanic, is kinda broken at this game. It's nice to have passwords on this and connect every player/friend is a nice improvement but it mess up invading system. While host is unupgraded itself, even with downgrades, overlevel phantoms do a lot of trouble like spamming spells, having late-game weapons.. It gives me cancer. Another thing is, game has open areas and sometimes, finding host is kinda impossible. Concord covenants has system that marks invader's place, why does invaders doesn't have one?I'll not going in to story and lore, because i don't exactly know it. Storytelling on every Soulslike FROM SOFTWARE is obscuring. Some parts are empty and you need to full them with your imaginaration, item descriptions and predictions.Cencorships are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. You can't even name your character Knight properly. If you need to write Knight, you need to make it like;KNightKnIghtKniGhtSeriously, you can't even make cosplay of characters, like Holy Knight Hodrick. Well, if you want, it'll look like **ly K***ht **drick. Well done, well done.One last thing before posting, why the hell we do backstab animations if we miss it?I am whining. Yes, i am. Because this game can be better. But however, it's still an excellent game. Even with it's mistakes. But after it's slowly losing players, i don't recommend this game at it's full price. Wait a discount, discounts makes this game more popular, player count raises a lot."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 5, 2016              At the time of posting this, the cheating that's going on it this game is still an issue. Both valve(I understand they don't have to) and fromSoft refuse to do anything about the cheaters who have been running around in this game. Having put in a ticket with both steam and bamco about this I basically got a whole lot of f*uck you in response. Cheats since last I played outside of 5 mins ago to see if anything changed(well over a month ago at this point) fake phantoms that serve as dmg sponges, the usual infinite health/stamina, and the most annoying of all being one that will actually get you softbanned by fromSoft. These are still a thing. What makes it so bad was that these cheats started popping up around 2 or so weeks after the game came out... The rest of this review is based on my own personal feelings as someone who has played as sorcery based classes since demon souls. As for the actual gameplay my major complaint, besides enemies following the tired formula of have infiite stamina to bash you with, is how bad sorcery has it this time around. No one was asking for from to make the game easy for us(don't understand how it ever was. Dodging skills were a must in agressive boss fights and pvp). However with 90% of the bosses in this game being aggressive and spells damage being nerfed hard, it makes boss fight needlessly difficult and maybe even a little unfair. Playing as melee, Spell damage has been given really odd base requirements before the it become decent. Starting at 60 int is where you'll start to see the damage accel at. Keep in mind that in previous souls game you maxed out at 60 if you were hardcore sorcery otherwise 50 was perfectly fine at you're still dangerous. Remember how soul spear and the crystal spells(bar homing crystal in dks1) were good? Yeah not so much in this game. Incredibly slow and in most cases outclassed by the arrow spells. I started the game as a spellsword thanks to some people on reddit I was able to see just how jacked sorcery really was. To start  my Dex was 25 and int 15 with base class being merc. Casting magic weapon wields an extra 50 points of dmg at best. I don't remember these results in the first 2 games. In DK1 with mild point allocation I remember seeing around 100 points of extra damage on an unupgraded weapon. In this game I deal with one swing 200~210 per swing on a normal enemy with a +3 Uchi. Respec to 31 dex and 21 int damage went from 263 to 290 with magic weapon. This was done as apparently you don't see minor returns on int until at least 20. So that's my opinion on this game from a spell slinger pov. I wanted to love this game. Really I did. But I have completely lost faith in from's ability to make an anti-cheat system that's worth a damn and that sorcery will stop being completely eclipsed by other styles of play."

The gameplay is tight and a bit faster than the previous DS games, discovery and pure skill will always be rewarded the most. Overall it's  worth the money."

Because just on virtue of this game being a Dark Souls title, it's still entirely above average compared to most AAA releases and it's still a joy to play in general. I had fun with it. The world design and lore is completely nonexistent compared to DS1 and the weapon balance, PVP, and DLC quality (entirely) is nowhere near DS2's level. It's an inferior game to each of its contemporaries (subjectivity!) but hey, it's still fun to play.Pick it up, blow 80 hours on it, play the others if you haven't. It's good."

I can easily say that this is currently my GOTY.STORYDark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark. You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame again. The protagonist is known as an  Unkindled,  a being considered less of a being than an Undead who is made from the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, as a result, burned their bodies into ash.The game does not have direct storytelling: no one spills what is happening to you, there is no quest menu, and the few cutscenes that you watch do not usually feature any dialogue. If you want to understand the story, you must examine the environment, read the description of each item, and go on the Wikia page to comprehend the lore.I honestly love this type of apporach, since you can easily avoid any type of story and just focus on the gameplay. But I find it near impossible that a player doesn't care about the backstory of the places that he visits or the enemies that he fights.GRAPHICSFirst of all: the game has frame drops that are always between 30 and 60FPS, but it never ruined the gameplay and it was barely noticable most of the times.The design of each area is gorgeous and rich of details: beautiful vistas, gothic cathedrals, burning villages, poisonous swaps... Exploring this decaying world is a joy, also thanks to the excellent enemy design inspired (mostly) by Bloodborne, without feeling derivative. The bosses that you fight are also intimidating and full of different movesets that change mid-way through the fight.Character creation has been improved, with basically the same editor of Bloodborne, but I recommend using the preset characters without many changes, unless you prefer to have an hilarious purple knight with green hair, red beard and a constant grin on his face.GAMEPLAYI highly recommend playing with a controller, even though the k/m controls have been improved. The gist hasn't changed: you can equip swords, spears, knives, shields, magic and many more in each hand, and you can use certain items. The Estus Flask recovers your HP, while the new Ashen Estus Flask recovers your FP (used for magic and special attacks), and the both fill each time you visit a bonfire, which works as Fast Travel and Respawn point.Each time you die, you lose your souls (that are both currency and XP), and you can recover them by going back to the place where you died, otherwise they'll be lost forever. There are Estus Shards and other items that can be used to improve your character's stats and items. You can go back to Firelink Shrine, which acts as your HUB, where you can talk to multiple NPCs and buy new items and upgrade weapons.There is also the multiplayer component which makes the game excellent: you can summon other players to help you fight bosses and get through difficult areas, or you can summon Dark Phantoms (who can also invade you while playing) to engage in some PvP.This is easily the perfect Souls game: everything has been improved, the combat is a bit faster (though not as fast as Bloodborne), and playing is just way more fun than in the other Souls games.CHALLENGEThe game is extremely challenging: every enemy that you encounter has the potential of killing you, and you must focus on each encounter to avoid getting hit. The boss fights are the hardest part of the game, but the true achievement of the developers is that they never feel impossible and unfair. If you die, it is your fault only: maybe you didn't dodge at the right moment, maybe you used too many Estus Flasks earlier, but it never is because a boss is designed to be nearly impossible (except for the Nameless King, screw him).SOUNDThe sound effects and the noises of the monsters are great as always. The voice acting is a bit over-the-top most of the times, with the famous sarcastic laughter at the end of almost every NPC conversation. The soundtrack that plays only during boss fights is top-notch: it makes each encounter feel epic, and at the same time it also scares you and makes you feel as if all hope is lost.REPLAYABILITYThe game is going to last you for a long time: there is PvP, coop, and multiple New Game+ modes that will keep you entertained, as well as secret areas and bosses to fight.Overall, DARK SOULS III is an excellent video game, and, in my opinion, the best game in the franchise. It is hard, fun, long, more accessible, and highly replayable. A must buy for every gamer out there, even at full price.Story: 8.5Graphics: 9Gameplay: 10Challenge: 10Sound: 9Replayability: 9ENJOYMENT: 9.5FRUSTRATION: 8Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook[www.facebook.com]Join my Steam group"

The world looks amazing, bosses are very good designed and the combat is decent enough.The only reason why this game recieves a downvote from me is the fact that From once again pushed out a poorly optimized game. So poorly that it literally went to poop as soon as it did hit release.75% of the community were upset about the mess and it toned down after a while. Now its only 25% consisting of mainly AMD users which still get lag from hell due to their bad job on optimization.Intead of working on a patch to fix the lag for the rest though, they push out balancing patches for weapons or the overall game.After the big banwave they actually started working on a serious issue, which is good. The ban-hackers have to be dealt with. Yet that is no excuse for the time before.We are one month and a few days more in and the game is still unplayable for most AMD users, including myself.I am forced to play on 20-25 FPS on any resolution or graphical setting with heavy stutters.,which forces me to play offline. This is a big issue as singleplayer is only a tiny part of the game."

First of I have to say the game plays amazingly fluent in PvE. Hitboxes are great, rolls feel really smooth. The bosses are some of the most memorable fights in the entire series. Although I genuinely dislike the artstyle of bloodbourne and Dark Souls 3, I have to say the game looks great, not amazing but great. Since release of Dark Souls 2 I became a massive Pvp enthusiast. Despite great flaws Dark Souls 2 offered endless motivation: a sheer endless amount of builds, weapon variety, great possibilities to outplay your opponent and much more. I feel like Dark Souls 3 misses out on so many of these things. Backstep invincibility frames are gone, power stance is gone, arenas are gone. This game feels like a downgrade in terms of online gameplay to me. Furthermore most of the weapons feel the same. Movesets are mostly the same and nothing extraordinary. Weight makes no difference for stamina recovery or invincibility frames which then gives no reason to use light weight armor at all. Also NG+ is another disappointment. No new enemies, no new armor or weapons, only upgraded versions of rings. So no real motivation to go into NG+ at least for me.  As for now one of the most core mechanics of the series is simply turned off: Poise. Wearing heavy armor used to give your character poise which resulted in you not being stunlocked by light attacks. Now that this is turned off you can get stunlocked by a rat even when wearing heavy armor. Bandai namco is denying that this feature is turned off and are simply saying:  works as intended .  In other words there is little to no hope this will ever get fixed. Dark Souls 2 has been a complete mess the first months after release too but not like this. Despite insanely broken weapons, spells, mechanics the game was still fun. I can not say this for Dark Souls 3. I want to love this game but I can't. All in all: If you are looking for singleplayer, this is your game. But in terms of online gameplay and PvP this game blows as for now. Maybe it will be fixed, probably not."

Imagine a strong mix of Demon Souls and Dark Souls 1 with that weird Bloodborne look and combat speed, with Dark Souls 2 drooling in the corner.  I forget my point, anyway:I'm gonna compare 3's aspects to the other two Dark Souls games because â¥â¥â¥â¥ You, Okay?PC Port/Performance: Trash, but playable, and better that DS1's Port (Just barely). A real shame after DS2/SotFS's port was so good. With low/Medium setting; Framerate flutters between 45-60 constantly, lowest I've seen it was about 30 during the Dancer's 2nd phase when she setsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on fire and starts spinning like an Autistic Child.(DS2 > DS3 > DS1)Difficulty/Challange:This feels like the Hardest, but thats because the combat speed is faster and all enemys are super aggressive for some reason. Basicly, imagine a DS1 enemy, but he's on Cocaine and injected adrenaline into hisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ oh, and he thinks you stole his Waifu Body Pillow. Real foaming at the mouthâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Anyway, they also have very fast, hard hitting attacks with like 12 attacks in a combo, and they take a 3 meter step forward during each attack. Basicly: â¥â¥â¥â¥. Bosses do this too, I'm looking at you Pontiff Sperglord and Booty of the Boreal Valley. Like seriously guys, chill the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out.(DS3 > DS1 > DS2)PvP/Cancer: First of all, invasions are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Invading is basicly asking for a 1v4, were you have -25% of your health, half your Estus Flasks (Yes, everyone gets Estus Flasks, its much worse than you think.), and any of the Gank Squad you injure will run away to heal. 'But Walrus, I can heal too?' You have a max of 7 Flasks, they have (5+x3) + 10+. In short, if you don't OHK the Host, you're Dead.'What about Poise?' Poise? What is that?'What about Weapon Balance?' Working as Intended - From's offical statment 2016The meta is Estoc and Dark Sword R1 spam, how fun. 80% of people also seem to have a Ceastus offhanded and a Hornet Ring hidden in their Vagoo (I equip it too to OHK Estus Chugging Hosts, sue me). (DS2 > DS1 > DS3)Weapon Arts:Some are okay, like the Longswords Guard Break. Others... Looks at Farron Greatsword make you spin around the floor like a Downy Orangutang having a sugar induced stroke. They're meh.Lore: It's okay as far as souls games go but the amount of Fanservice and DS1â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Riding is stupidly prevelent. Hell, I made fun of DS2 for making not so subtle refrences to 1, but â¥â¥â¥â¥ me, 3 doesn't even try to hide it or be subtle. Oh, HERE'S â¥â¥â¥â¥ING ANDRE FROM DS1. He should be long dead, why is he here? BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU WET. Thats true, but I need a real reason. Silence Okay...(DS1 > DS3 > DS2)Waifus/Boobs:I feel like there's little choice here. The Firekeeper is okay, but a cheap knockoff of Bloodbornes Doll Waifu. Not many Boobs ethier other than maybe Rosaria almost Nip Slip. The clear winner here is the Dancer of thr Boreal Valley, because of her butt. Rated D for Dayum. I'll stop now. (DS1 > DS2 > DS3)Also, this is how I picture each Game in my Head:DS1: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652946742DS2: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642794419DS3: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=680820330I may have some sort of mental Problem.Anyway, 'Is Dank Souls 3 good Papa Walrus?' Its okay, probably the Hardest, worth a try."

Now when i play the game i beat gundyr without taking any damage. And thats the beauty of the dark souls for me overcoming the challanges and making them your bi*ch,and feling â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great when you do that. Dark souls 3 is the best in the series by my opinion. I have played dark souls 1 and 2 too but i dont enjoy them as much as i enjoy dark souls 3. Level design is best in dark souls 1 but where dark souls 3 shines the most is in combat. Its fast and the dodging feels reliable unlike dark souls 2 where there is input lag and im scared when i need to dodge because it sucksâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in dark souls 2, no longer you need to use a shield because of that and that makes for some great action. So in conclusion combat is best in the series.I really love this game and it helped me a lot with depresion,when i was feeling sorrow in my hearth i was at least sattisfied that i killed gael in second try.Thank you dark souls 3"

Maybe I'll change this when and if things get better.The game feels like several steps forwards and several steps backwards. The bosses are a lot better and more fun to fight this time around, though a good amount of them are still humanoid bosses, a common criticism for Dark Souls 2. Poise, for some odd reason, has been turned off, giving way to faster weapons being better and weapons that give super armor. The Covenants were made easier to switch between as you can just  equip  them but are even less interesting and have some design flaws (Like Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon basically being the same thing).The world design is much more linear now, while not a concern of mine, it can be for a lot of people.Anti-cheat is basically non-existent and is a joke. Again. Enjoy being banned by some dude giving you free souls by stabbing you.There are still performance issues that I feel shouldn't be there."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 27, 2016              Best game I have played in a long time!This game is brilliant. It takes all the parts of the original, mixes it with some ideas from Dark souls 2, and then takes the mastery of combat and atmosphere from Bloodborne and creates a masterpiece. I of course think there are a few problems with the game, especially because it's AAA game, but it is as close to perfect as I expect from a videogame.It's my favorite game to date, and it really feels like it's an improvement from Dark souls 1, mostly because of the bigger budget, better tech and more development time.GraphicsThe game looks great, even though it has some freezes here and there, which doesn't surprise me since this is a namco game. They are not known for good PC ports sadly, but this one feels more solid, which probably is because of the backlash from ports they have made in the past.BalancingAll the different builds and classes have been balanced out. Now you can choose between how many Ashen Estus flasks (They restore mana) and how many Estus Flasks you want. This means that magic is a lot more useful.Weapons also have weapon arts, that basicly use up mana to do cool things like buffing you, penetrating shields and more! Shortbows can now also be good for long ranged combat and have special weapon arts so you can quickly do damage from a far with the cost of losing mana.This means that all builds use mana, and I even, who focused on DEX and Vigor, ended up using some pyromancies to give my sword fire damage and make me more resistant to fire. At the same time pyromancies are now scaled so the most awesome pyromancies require you to level up in intelligence and faith. In the original game, pyromancy was great for every build, which I honestly found irritating, since it made it so everyone used pyromancy. Something that i found got a litte repetitive.You can also speed up spellcasting with rings and putting points into dexterity which is great for sorcerers!You can't upgrade armor!This is great in my opinion! I love the fact that an armor is usefull to begin with. Even though taking care of your character and making them as powerful as you can is a great part of the game, having a new armor set and being able to just use it the minute you get is great!Location, location, locationThe locations in Dark Souls 3 are very diverse, though sometimes it seems like they are just trying to play with your nostalgia. I won't mention the locations, since spoiling it removes the fun, but just be sure to know that if you have played the original dark souls, you will be happy to see all the old locations, but also feel a little irritated. Though overall the locations are great and there are of course hidden areas with bosses and loot!The BossesThe bosses are great! Some of they require a lot of skill, some of them not so much. Though generally I found them to way better than dark souls 2's bosses. Though in my opinion dark souls 2 wasâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I would say that they are about as good as dark souls 1's. They better fight in the technical department, but they a little less memorable. Luckily the bosses are all new, and are not just new versions of old bosses. They are a fun, challenging and satisfying. There is one boss in the game that comes up in the middle of the campaign that i found to be way too hard. Probably the only boss i can't without help.ProblemsThe game has a few issues though. This is mostly because of the mutiplayer. Firstly there is a bug that makes it so players lack animations. This normally also means that if you are invading or co-oping with another player, all the enemies in their world have no animations and won't be able to hurt you.I have recently seen it way less, so maybe they have fixes it.Another problem is that apparently you can't play mutiplayer if you have a VAC ban. I am not entirely sure how it works, since i experienced no problems in that field. Though if you have a VAC ban i would recommend not buying the game at it's current state, unless you are fine with not being able to player mutiplayer.Warping bonfiresA thing that i found was done surprisingly well were the warping bonfires. Normally shortcuts make you use older bonfires since they are all of sudden close to areas and bosses and I found that there are a lot of shortcuts compared to the original. The shortcuts are less about making the traveling time between areas shorter though and more about making the individual areas feel connected. It did feel like some areas got less used, but honestly it was not a big problem for me, and it felt like it was a thing that the development team wanted to get right.My very biased conclusionThere are a lot of things to go into, but generally this game rocks! It's not as hard as people say, it just requires a little patients and being open to failing. If you don't fail you will never succeed. It has some problems that I find to be really irritating, but most of them will probably be fixed in patches.Enjoy dying, I know i did, and have fun exploring the world of dark souls!"

        "Comments": "Posted: August 8, 2017              I can't recommend this game highly enough. It's genuinely, in my opinion, one of the best games of the past decade. It is punishing but fair. It makes every little accomplishment feel amazing. The challenge of this game is part of what makes it so fun. You gradually learn how to fight, and progress from struggling to fight little dogs to killing literal gods. The atmosphere is so dense and rich. The game itself looks amazing (look up screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley for some stunning examples). Each region has its own distinct enemies and style, most of which are engaging and enjoyable. (Except the Irithyll Dungeon with those stupid jailers -_- )The story and plot is very bleak and dark, but in a refreshing and captivating way. It isn't thrust in your face like many modern titles do. It's dripped to you in subtle little hints in such a way that you gradually piece together what is happening in this miserable world you find yourself in. Being able to pick up on little hints rather than having a massive sign with neon lights pointing at every plot point is a smart way to reward exploration, and really helped me to immerse myself in the world.Compared to DS1, it feels more responsive, less buggy, more pretty and more well designed overall. One gripe is it is definitely slightly more linear than previous titles in the series, but that is in a way a trade off, as this game is able to balance itself far better than DS1 was (particularly in the end game) and doesn't have a massive drop off in quality at any points.It's freaking great, not a tonne more I can really say at this stage.Jeez dude just play the game already I'm gushing far too much."

A solid 8/10 honestly, very good closing game for the souls series. Is it the end of souls? I dunno, companies these days would beat any dead horsejust to keep their capita's heart pumping.STORY?:So, the story, first thing I want to address, I have no idea what the hell is going on.You have to kill some Abyss Watchers, a giant called Yhorm, Aldrich the snail guy and two cripples so you can start a new age of fire or bring upon the age of dark, as per usual, nothing much has changed with the story as in the previous games. For anybody that really gives a heck about lore I'd suggest you go watch VaatiVidya or whoever the heck is hogging the youtube views from making up theories that Miyazaki later just <can't show this word on a christian gameing site!> on.COMBAT:So combat, pretty fun, pretty challenging, don't get hit, but hit back. Two attack buttons, this time dual wielding is available, no power stance, boohoo what can you do.Two attack buttons, a block, parry button, backstep and dodge. I know it sounds like  oh wow that's not that complex  yeah, it's not that complex until you get into PvP Isuppose, then you really need to think what to do. From charged R2's, regular attack into a special with a finishing charged R2, you got plenty of ways to kill your enemies, just make sure you don't get killed of course.The game is this time around way faster than DS1 and DS2, feels like Miyazaki liked Bloodborne so much he wanted to make another one but then remembered he was making a soulsgame halfway through the development.Shoutout to the parry kings out there though, you guys are killing it.BOSSES IN THE BASE GAME:Bosses are all cool and dandy, none of them do really feel unfair, at least in the base game. I got one complaint on the difficulty curve with Pontif of Sulyvahn, because he is probably one of the hardest bosses in the game, and throwing him out there like that felt like a  casual filter  as some would say. Like I imagine that's a point where a bunch of people just rage quitted, or is it just me? Might be me, I am still a casual.THE DLC'S:Anyway as I said, none of them feel unfair in the base game, but in the Ringed City DLC a lot of players have been complaining about Midir's massive health pool, so I guess you could write that one down as an  unfair  boss, even though he's just more tedious than anything.The two DLC's though? Ashes of Ariandel was a dang letdown and don't let anybody tell you otherwise. Two bosses? Yeah I regret getting a season pass just because of that DLC. And no the arena was not worth it, the usual invasions are much more fun than that. But it's too late to cry about that now I suppose.Ringed City though, boy oh boy, that one surprised me. Don't get me wrong I expected From to make a DLC to make up for their mistake with Ashes of Ariandel but the sheer sizeand content of this DLC was amazing, it might even be better than the DLC from Dark Souls 1, simply glorious, honestly get Ringed City you will not be disappointed. Amazing 4 boss fights and a lot of cool weapons and spells are just waiting for you to pick them up.THE WEAPON AND ARMOR:Armor in this game has no upgrades and poise is useless outside of hyper armor. If you're not using a slow weapon that hits hard, wearing havels really won't matter. But if you're using a havels while you're wielding the Fume UGS then you can bet that you will out-trade anybody in PvP no matter who it is. Well unless you get outsmarted. In which case if you're wearing Havels and are using the Fume and do get outsmarted I suggest you delete the game and never come back on steam you filthy casual.Weapons are amazing as far as I'm concerned, sure From doesn't know how to balance them, but a lot of weapons are just amazing and I love the different weapon arts that each of them have. Just today I found out the Man Serpent Hatchet had charge with the charged R2 after you use the warcry, 10/10 surprised me really.The weapon upgrades might be some of the most detailed in the game, you have heavy, sharp, raw, chaos, fire, simple, refined, hollow, dark, deep, I'm sure I missed some,but yeah a lot of upgrades to choose, so that was a very nice thing.THE PVP:Not sure what to think about it. On another hand I love killing people, but on the other hand the netcode makes it unbearable at times. Well, might have something to do with my internet. Can't wait till I upgrade to a 4G internet from my 3 million BC slavic router. Do not go into PvP expecting everything to be peaches and cream honestly."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 15, 2016              Not having any of the crashing issues reported by others, Performance is fine with 60 fps even in the places people reported slow downs.Noticed the player count for this game was up to 120K+ So I'm not surprised a small minority are having issues as it's the nature of PC Gaming, No game is released perfect.A lot of people seem to be complaining about performance issues that are either using low end hardware or laptops because they are able to run Dark Souls II at silky smooth frame rates.Something to remember about this is Dark Souls II was built for and designed around the limitations of the hardware inside the PS3 and XBOX360. Dark Souls III was designed from the ground up to run on the current generation consoles the PS4 and XBOXONE, These consoles while still being under powered compared to a modest gaming desktop are still substantially more powerful than their predecessors and benefit from being static hardware making it easier to optimize for.But even so, BloodBorne and Dark Souls III both run at 30fps with drops down into the 20's on these consoles.So it shouldn't come as a shock to people that they can't run Dark Souls III at 60fps in MAX settings like they could in Dark Souls II with the same hardware. These games are a generation apart in terms of graphical power requirements.Dark Souls III uses much more complicated geometry,Better lighting effects, Higher texture resolution, Higher shadow resolution, Improved enemy AI and more.+Great graphics and art design, Attention to detail is as good as ever and really helps to captivate and immerse you into the gameplay. Mobs are also very detailed and feel like they belong in their respective area.+Some of the best boss designs/Fights of the series.+Amazing soundtrack, Boss music is epic.+Rewarding gameplay, Tougher and smarter mobs.+Seemingly infinite replayability from the sheer amount of equipment and build variety the game offers. Co-op gameplay and PVP with many covenants designed around it.+Possibility of 6 players total in online play.-Network lag and online hit detection needs some work.-Game kicks to the main menu if the online connection is lost regardless of what you're doing.-Poise system could use some rebalancing as it's almost irrelevant in it's current form.-No steam cloud support-No current known anti-cheat in placeOverall I see this as a great addition to the Souls Series and an excellent game in general.Highly recommendedEDIT: Also something I would just like to put to rest is the illogical argument people put forward about this game being like Bloodborne as a bad thing.First of all Sony asked From Software for a new game as they needed an exclusive IP for their console the PS4 and thus Bloodborne was.....born (kek).So it really isn't suprising that Bloodborne shared a lot of simmilarities with the souls series, Considering it was made by the same developers and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.It's a shame that Bloodborne is exclusive to the PS4, But it's still an excellent game from the guys at From Software.So saying  This game sucks, It's too much like Bloodborne  is a completely illogical thing to say  because both games are great. And if both games are great, Saying one is bad because it's too much like the other is an absolute nonsensical argument."

The hitreg can also be horrible at times. If you're playing against another player, prepare for a lot of lag. You might not even hit someone but they will still take damage and vice versa.If you're new to the dark souls series, this is likely the best one to start off with, although Dark Souls 1 isn't bad to start off with either. Just don't touch Dark Souls 2 unless you're committed to finishing them all.Screw Darkeater Midir."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 12, 2016              Why do I recommend this game?Okay so I've played lots of this game already, over 200 hours. I've 100% completed it, and I've done the same for all previous titles not including Demon's Souls because screw you Fromsoft and your Pure Bladestone.So I'm a fan of the series, it's safe to say, and Dark Souls III hits the mark for me really well. If you liked previous titles and you want more of the same, this game has it, you will enjoy it no doubt.My only complaints right now are small, and there's one huge issue with the game regarding online play. I'll get on to that after I talk about the game a little. The lore/story So I started the game with very little knowledge about what to expect, and I also started alongside a bunch of friends who also bought the game. We all played our first characters solo though, so we could get a better feel for the bosses and learn the game a bit better. Without spoiling anything, this game has fan service from previous titles, and some of it is purely there to get a reaction from returning players. That was kind of a disappointment for me, but as I played on and kept reading item descriptions, some of the returning locations/items/NPCs actually made sense within the world itself. For that, I was happy. The story this time around is again, more of the same, but that is not a bad thing. I love the rich lore in Fromsoft games and I love how much love is put into item descriptions and NPC dialogue, something which you can choose to ignore or dig real deep into it and learn all the secrets about the lore. The bosses The bosses are amazing, I really enjoyed a lot of the bosses, with really only two of them lacking in my opinion. I did not like the Wolnir or Deacons of the Deep boss fights. I didn't like Wolnir's mechanics but overall was a VERY cool boss in design and concept. I didn't like the Deacons either, because well, it's a typical Fromsoft multi-enemy boss fight.  And now... the bad part  The fact is (and no one likes admitting this) Fromsoft are bad at multiplayer. There's always issues surrounding the multiplayer and it's always been an issue in the previous games, and now this one. I'm not talking about balance and overall functionality, I'm talking anti-cheat and their stance on banning people. In Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition (the first game, on PC that is) had NO anti-cheat whatsoever, so cheaters where rampant and nothing could be done about it, other than playing kiss chase off of a ledge for the hacker to die from fall damage. Fromsoft were very unexperienced in PC titles and they did a bad job of Dark Souls 1. It wasn't terrible though, because the mod DSfix cured that game. Dark Souls II was the same, it had no proper anti-cheat. Except this time around it had soft bans. The way someone was selected for a soft ban is simple, they monitored the servers and players for any suspicious activity and if they spotted something out of place and they could confirm it to be cheating. You were soft banned, but... they didn't tell you that you had been banned and you had to email Bandai Namco just to find out if you were. Obviously this system has its flaws just like any other anti-cheat system, but the big problem is the hackers were still everywhere and softbans didn't really help.Fast forward to the release of Dark Souls III and this game has had almost the exact repeated problems, except people are being softbanned for rediculous reasons, like playing in offline mode or picking up an item that they didn't know was cheated in using a third party program.At least you get an error message when there's invalid data. All you have to do is use a backed up save. What if you don't? Enjoy playing offline.To close out, all I'll say is it's the best Dark Souls to date, in my honest opinion. The issues regarding multiplayer can be solved over time, and once they are, this game will be a hell of a game.TL;DRThe game is good. Has some multiplayer issues regarding softbans. Good lore. Good Bosses. I recommend."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 12, 2016              Why do I recommend this game?Okay so I've played lots of this game already, over 200 hours. I've 100% completed it, and I've done the same for all previous titles not including Demon's Souls because screw you Fromsoft and your Pure Bladestone.So I'm a fan of the series, it's safe to say, and Dark Souls III hits the mark for me really well. If you liked previous titles and you want more of the same, this game has it, you will enjoy it no doubt.My only complaints right now are small, and there's one huge issue with the game regarding online play. I'll get on to that after I talk about the game a little. The lore/story So I started the game with very little knowledge about what to expect, and I also started alongside a bunch of friends who also bought the game. We all played our first characters solo though, so we could get a better feel for the bosses and learn the game a bit better. Without spoiling anything, this game has fan service from previous titles, and some of it is purely there to get a reaction from returning players. That was kind of a disappointment for me, but as I played on and kept reading item descriptions, some of the returning locations/items/NPCs actually made sense within the world itself. For that, I was happy. The story this time around is again, more of the same, but that is not a bad thing.

        "Comments": "Posted: November 6, 2016              For the third and final Dark Souls game, there are some really worrying issues. I still love DSIII but will start off with the problems cos there are so many.- Enemies have a tendency to sometimes get stuck inside the architecture, fall through floors/ceilings, and if you rotate the camera, some enemies will teleport or have their animations cancelled. Dogs and Silver Knights are the best examples but it happens with other mobs too.- Walls don't seem to be as solid as they appear, since there are times where I have been shot with arrows/bolts through the bricks and buildings I was using as cover. One enemy type just shoots pyro's through buildings. - It is possible to kill enemies that spawn only once which have a guaranteed drop of a ring or some such item, only to get summoned to someone else's world at the exact moment of killing it. When returning after the summon, the item is not there and the non-respawning enemy is nowhere to be seen. In essence it is possible to lose items in a playthrough and have to go to the next cycle to obtain it. - It's possible to get cornered by an enemy and try to roll out of the corner through what appears to be empty space, yet the enemy's hitbox prevents you from rolling out. Since every mob in the game has chain-attacks of up to 5 or 6 with minimal cooldown this is really frustrating as once you are trapped by an invisible barrier, you quickly get stunlocked to death. - I died a few seconds before a cutscene, but the cutscene played anyway, and warped me to an at the time unfamiliar location (since it was my first playthrough) and that location was where the game decided I actually died. But I respawned at my previous bonfire with no way of knowing where to go to recover my souls... - My souls have dropped in places that should be impossible (in the Nameless King boss arena).- Desync in co-op/pvp is a fairly big issue. As a phantom I can't traverse the boss fog to help the host at least 15% of the time, character models of other players frequently get frozen and they just glide along stuck in a pose, and sometimes it takes a minute or two for invaders to sync to the host.They've had almost a year to patch things up and the game still feels like it lacks polish in many areas.In terms of how the game's combat plays out, it feels like DS1 - which is to say it feels like a bit of a step backwards compared to DS2.Attack cancelling should have been kept considering how much faster paced the enemy and boss encounters are. Left hand movesets are back to DS1's days of being less functional than they should be - which really makes you wonder why From expects everyone to play as a right-handed character.Weapon upgrade restrictions mean that if you do low SL runs with high-upgraded weapons, your character won't be able to co-op with other randoms. Password system means that if people weren't twinking in DS1 or 2, they probably are now.In many of ways almost feels like a re-imagining of, and a love-letter to the first game. The atmosphere is amazingly tense throughout and the sense of achievement when you fell a difficult boss is tremendous. Boss movesets are significantly more complex than the bosses of old, leaving few openings to attack and attacking much more aggressively than ever before.The various mobs are fearsome - some even horrifying, and each different environment you travel to feels like even your surrounds are out to get you.Oh, and the world is just stunning to look at. Lothric is a place of decaying beauty and it's easy to get lost in the majestic vistas you will journey through. From a decaying castle with towering cathedrals, to an icy city of cathedrals, to a deep, epicly huge chapel, and... yea there's lots of cathedrals but it's all total eye candy.The length of the campaign is perfect. Not too overlong, but it's by no means something you'll knock off in 20 or even 30 hours on your first blind playthrough.An entertaining, if not very buggy swan-song for the Souls franchiseedit: after so many patches with the fun stuff being removed, you'd think they'd do something about the abysmal netcode. I love the game, but am not recommending due to the fact I feel like I'm playing Goat Simulator Souls alot of the time"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 10, 2016              Dark Souls 3 has both upsides and downsides compared to the previous titles.As it's own game, it is great, but still very rough on newcommers.Several game mechanics are once again not being explained and without help from other players or a guide, the avarage player is going to miss even entire areas with their own bosses and items on his/her first playthrough(s).However Souls-Veterans are also going to face a few new mechanics as well.The game's world is both beautiful and dark. Sometimes even both at the same time. There are countless different enemy designs and fighting through the areas was mostly challanging and fun.Especially the bosses later in the game are very tough, some even frustratingly hard. Dark Souls is known to be harsh but fair, this also applies to Dark Souls 3 for the most part. However there are also occasions, where I had to question, if that stunlock, gigantic hitbox or speed is really reasonable. Overall it is still fair, but some moments left a bitter taste. Dark Souls 3 plays in the same world as the other 2 titles, therefore many different weapons and items make a return and a couple of npcs are directly from the other games. However Dark Souls 3 also recycles/reuses many of the ideas, it goes so far that some of the moments already felt like fanservice for players that also played through the other games. It is not necessarily bad, but to me it seemed really forced sometimes.Something else that I missed were connections between areas. Unlike in Dark Souls 1, the world's areas all feel very seperated, even though they are technically very close to each other. Also the player does not have to look for cross-area connections, because he can teleport to other discovered areas right from the get go.Connecting to specific players got easier, now you can just use a password in the Menu's settings, instead of having to use a ring or even change your whole download region in the steam settings. This only applies to Summon Signs though, as long as you're online and you meet the conditions, you can end up being assaulted by other players.PvP exists in 2 ways, either random invasions, where one player appears in a different player's game to kill him, or as dueling, where players summon other players as enemy into their world on purpose via Red Summon Signs.Invasions prioritize hosts that have coop partners at their side, which helps PvE players, but makes the job difficult for those who want to ambush other players in their world.The online experience tends to suffer from latency issues, mostly relevant for PvP. A Region Lock exists, but it doesn't seem to do anything (similar to how it was in previous titles).I did not enjoy the PvP as much as in Dark Souls 2 for multiple reasons: - Most of my favorite weapons are bad for PvP in the current Patch, because of inferior damage and/or speed, which means I have to use something that I don't enjoy using, when I want to win. - A large number of weapon movesets got straight up copied from other weapons and there is a high number of weapon moves that are either situational or just completely outclassed/useless- Especially the strong attacks on many weapons are only useful, when the opponent is far away, because they are much slower than light attacks without giving much of an advantage, therefore the combat loses a lot of depthDark Souls 3 is still definitely worth playing for the PvE content already, but it is a shame that the PvP is lackluster. Hopefully things will change over the next months with the upcomming dlc content and further patches."

Skyrim was my favorite game for a long time, and I thought it would go unmatched for much longer than it did. Now, don't get me wrong, Skyrim is still at least in the top three. However, Dark Souls III has a truly unique experience, maybe with a few nods to other FromSoft games. Not only this, but the difficulty is brutal. This can turn people off, but if you have played any other SoulsBorne games, you would understand why I, and many others, love the difficulty. This is because of the incredible feeling of victory when you defeat that boss that drove you insane for a day or two. That feeling of success is the best thing you will ever feel as a gamer, and that's one of the reasons that this is the best game you can possibly play.     Another reason you should play the game is because of the lore. Some people don't care about this as much as I do, but I think the lore is a great addition to the bosses or enemies you slay. Knowing your purpose and the purpose of your enemies drives you even further to kill the boss, or in some cases, makes you regret doing it. A great example of this is Sif, The Great Grey Wolf from Dark Souls I. You most likely won't feel good killing the companion of a proud and renowned knight, that just want's to guard her master's grave. On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have Pontiff Sulyvahn of the game I am currently reviewing. He slaughtered, kidnapped, and lied his way into power, and betrayed his sense of justice for power. I feel that this should make you want to kill him more for it, and you will feel better for doing it, too.     Finally, the multiplayer. Again, this topic might be controversial. Some people hate being invaded, and just want to play the game. That's okay, but you don't have to get invaded. Just don't use any embers until you're ready for PvP. You can also co-op with friends or randoms thanks to the white soapstone, available for only 500 souls. You can only co-op while embered, though, so be careful. Also, take note that souls will be split during boss fights, depending on how many people there are fighting the boss. This shouldn't be that bad, because even though they don't respawn, you can just opt to fight them again in another person's world. You can also summon enemies, if you want a fair one-on-one duel. You don't need to be embered to summon these, so don't use one. This way, no one can invade you while you're fighting a fair fight. Do be wary of internet connection, though.     Note: Hardware might be an issue, but I'm assuming that since you are here, you should have the proper equipment.     Overall Score: 9.5/10, Sometimes Invasions and Connectivity can be an issue, but you can avoid that if you're so inclined."

By no means is it as good as the first Dark Souls because that created it all but this is certainly a huge step above the second game, I loved this game from start to finish even though it might've been a bit easier than previous installments.8.5 Sunbros out of 10"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 11, 2016              Ever since I got my hands on Dark Souls 3 I was simply transfixed. All of my waking hours have been spent in an endless pursuit of souls to further grow my collection of fancy weapons, and despite praising the Sun I don't remember the last time I've seen it. I have become something alike the hollows that roam the land, utterly consumed by Dark Souls 3.At this point its fairly well known that Dark Souls 3 is good, but I don't think simply 'good' does it justice given that I am currently thinking long and hard on whether Dark Souls 1 is still my favorite game of all time. So what exactly makes Dark Souls 3 so compelling, and how does it match up against the entirety of the extended Souls family?The first thing one will notice with Dark Souls 3 is that its an evolution of all the concepts found in previous games, with the biggest influence coming from Bloodborne, what with the numerous dilapidated hamlets, dirty villagers driven mad by things far beyond their understanding, and a constant oppressive aura that spreads throughout the majority of locations. The combat is another good example as its much, much faster than what you might find in Dark Souls 1 and 2, while still retaining that slow, methodical pace we've all come to love about the Souls series.Naturally, since we as the players get better character handling, faster dodge-rolling, and overall superior combat mechanics, the monsters get their own set of upgrades as well. They are far more aggressive than in previous games, able to chain multiple attacks in order to punish you for expending your stamina, and most importantly, a fair bit smarter than the bunch that precedes them, though they still have issues grasping the concept of doors.As for the encounter design, I believe Dark Souls 2's catch phrase fits here rather well: Prepare to die! After seeing players stomp all over their games for a couple of years now, FromSoftware have stopped pulling punches, and have designed enemies and locations in such a way that they will often punish the unwary traveler, while simultaneously greatly rewarding those that think outside of the box.While Dark Souls 3 may be a brutal mistress, it does love you, so almost every time it horrifically murders you, throws you off a cliff, or has rats gnaw on your kneecaps, it also gives you a bonfire shortly afterwards, both as an apology, and as a reward for a battle well fought. The end result of this sort of level design is that I never feltâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off after dying, instead I would keep all of my anger bottled up within me for the 30 seconds it took to run back to where I was, promptly go medieval on whoever killed me, die again because I was reckless, and then finally decide to try and approach the situation like a sane person.But perhaps the best encounter-related feature of Dark Souls 3 is that the dreaded puzzle bosses, ie. bosses that require you to deal with secondary mechanics besides simply fighting them, are for once interactive, and most importantly, fun to do. My favorite example of this is a boss fight that occurs relatively early in the game against a Wizard that is weak on his own, but is capable of spawning powerful illusions from the crystals he throws around everywhere. Instead of simply smashing his face in like you would with Pinwheel from Dark Souls 1, you will need to actually deal with the crystals by choosing on the fly which ones to destroy, and which ones to ignore as you endlessly pursue a boss that likes to run away and laugh at you. The final thing I want to mention is the exploration as the open-ended levels from Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne are back with a vengeance. There are secrets and side-areas almost everywhere, so much so that despite considering myself an obsessively thorough explorer I managed to completely miss one boss, a fact that a friend who never even touched Dark Souls 3 pointed out to me when he noticed a hillside path I managed to completely gloss over. Worst of all for my sanity, I've found exactly one secret wall, which is just enough to let me know that they exist, and that I've probably missed dozens!Closing ThoughtsThere is so much more I want to talk about, but this review is already running long, so allow me to simply end with this: After playing Dark Souls 3 non-stop for the past week, the only thing I am currently looking forward to is playing even more of it. After all, I have to go back and beat the living daylight out of the damn knight that has managed to best me over a dozen times now, because as everyone knows, if you don't beat someone at first, you keep throwing bodies at them until you do!If you're interested in a more detailed review, I welcome you to either check out the written version I've done:http://www.gamesear.com/reviews/dark-souls-3-detailed-review-from-a-long-time-fanOr the video review that backs everything up with some pretty pictures:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LNPxb7yxtQ"

I have over 40 hours on the PS4 version and currently I am deep into the PC version, which is superior in graphical fidelity and performance. Dark Souls III has some of the coolest looking bosses I have ever seen, with epic music that alternates during the second phase of a fight. There are also tons of sidequests to be completed, secrets to be found and unique characters with charming personalities.For once, I am actually excited for Dark Souls III DLC to be released. I'm looking forward to the future of the Souls series and hope that it continues on the current path.Go out there and become a Lord of Hollows.__________________________________________Check out our full Dark Souls III Review at GameRevolution here: http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls-iii"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 9, 2016              A lot of games do yearly iterations of some sort, and usually people roll their eyes and growl angrily. Case in point: that new Call of Duty: Bioshock Infinite edition seems to have broken global hate records for some reason. While I'm not sure I agree 100% that yearly sequels are evil, I will say that I pay very little attention to them generally.From Software's Souls of the Week series is a strange little exception to that rule. I've wound up buying the PC versions of all their Souls-y games at some point, regardless of the fact that broadly, they're extremely similar games. I think they get away with it because the games themselves have no market equivalent. If you don't like Battlefield du Jour, there's a Rainbow Six or Call of Booker DeWitt for you. While obviously these games aren't the same, they hit the same broad strokes: military dudes shooting other military dudes in extremely contrived yet intense scenarios. I cannot think of a game like Dark Souls without having to seriously qualify the statement. I'm not aware of another series that apes survival horror, action-rpg, and adventure games so well.Dark Souls 3 is no exception to this.Basically, you've played DS3 already if you've ever played Dark Souls and Bloodborne around the same time. DS3 is the fastest entry in the core series. Enemies hit hard and often, and leave hilariously little room for error, even more so than DS1 and 2's more punishing fights. The combat, fortunately, is a little more forgiving than its predecessors. Dodge rolls work against attacks you won't believe, and frequently I found rolling into an attack somehow stopped it from working outright (I remember collision detection in DS1 stopping my rolly antics quite thoroughly).Dark Souls 3's map design is a bit lacking in my opinion. Namely, there's a lot less choice this time. I can't think of any real branching paths that stay branching for very long. Most of the time, you'll be exploring cathedrals and castles. The overall map variety might be the only thing Dark Souls 2 did better than its sister (better) games, and Dark Souls 3 doesn't have a lot to show for itself in this regard.That said, Dark Souls 3 shines in a few separate areas. It doesn't have the quirky-yet-haunting lore of DS1, but tells a reasonable tale in its own right. A particular, powerful motif is vulnerability. I built up a roster of friendly NPCs around the closest thing the game has to a home, and slowly watched them abandon me, or outright die, one by one. Generally, this happened because the game demands you care for and watch over them, something I failed to do many times. Solemn, powerful stuff.Dark Souls 3's greatest boon is its roster of bosses. There are 19 in the game, each one memorable in a way not even DS1 attained consistently. I might just be willing to argue that DS3's boss design has no equal in gaming. No, these aren't the hardest bosses in the series. But each fight offers firm stakes, be it a change in the timing of blows, disorienting arenas, strong ties to complex underlying lore, or simply great design. DS3's worst boss encounters would be the highlight of many other action-RPGs.There's not really much to say beyond this. It's a Souls game. Chances are, you know if you're bound to like it. It doesn't offer the raw invention of DS1, but it's more grounded and whole than DS2. If nothing else, it's a fantastic note to end the series on."

System meets or exceedes all recommended settings and crashing about every 2-3 minutes. I cant even get thru the first area since as soon as I spend any time near a bonfire I CTD. So for right now go back to DS2 and enjoy that while they work this out. I am hoping they will have it fixed by the weekend so I can get some good time in but tired of banging my head against a wall from a silly bug."

Balance and content issues are all around, and arguably the older games were better. But I still love it and play it far too much. Why? Well, there are a lot of reasons. It's my first Souls game, which leads me to not be able to see a lot of its flaws, and I do love the combat of this series, which is probably some of the best I've ever said. This isn't a game for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying at least. I can't promise you'll enjoy your time, but it'll be a damn experienceP.S. GIT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ GUD YOU CASUL"

It's a weird mish-mash of Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, and Bloodborne with a few new things, but it's Dark Souls.Because of it not fully having it's own identity it feels like less of a cogent experience, but it's Dark Souls.It's not very well optimised, but it's Dark Souls.Keyboard & mouse are pain, but it's Dark Souls.It still has bugged/laggy hitboxes in PvE AND PvP, but it's Dark Souls.There's plenty of cheating & hacking in multiplayer, but it's Dark Souls.Some things have been dumbed down or made easier, but it's still Dark Souls.90% of the messages you read will say  Try finger/tongue but hole,  But it's still Dark Souls.Almost nothing is explained in any meaningful way so better get that google search ready, because it's still Dark Souls.Welcome to Dark Souls."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 28, 2016              What to say about this game? Where to start?I am a newcomer to the Dark Souls. From time to time I would stumble upon video or gif of Dark Souls games, but I didn't understand anything. Only thing that I knew is that these games are hard. Well I bought Dark Souls 3 and I see why others are hooked. So many secrets, hidden areas and mistery lore that even the biggest Dark Souls fans still try to figure it out. You will be hungry for more and more. Which area is next? What will it bring to you? Which boss is there? What is the lore of this area/monsters/boss? A loot in the distance, how to get to it? Is it maybe rubbish or some cool armor? So many questions.Creatures are interesting and well designed. Each area has unique feeling and the combat system is top-notch. Just amazing.If you are a newcomer to this game, don't be afraid. It is challenging and sometimes hard, but if you get stuck remember to Google some info about the boss fights or some tips for hard areas. Also, I am playing with mouse + keyboard so controller is not essential.And after you beat the game you will be happy and content. But what about other classes? What about hidden quests that you missed during the first playthrough? Or that cool weapon that you didn't use? This game has an amazing replay value. I wouldn't even call this a replay value, because you will learn something new each playthrough.Oh and PvP? Yes there it is, but I'll leave it to you ;)As for problems, there are still some performance issues, mostly crashes that can be frustrating. I hope they fix this in future patches.No more performance issues.This is really a GOTY. Must buy!9.5/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 1, 2016              Oh boy, Where to start...We all know Dark Souls has a  reputation  of sorts. Be it good or bad, nearly everyone has heard something about it. From the hilarious/infuriating/epic PVP, To the rage inducing,.... everything else. My Rating: Overall:  8/10 *  *Uses the âVery Good!â carving, and then praises the sun*Graphics: 7/10 Good but not cutting edge. Expect reused assets from previous âFrom Softwareâ games.Gameplay: 9/10 Viceral, cut-throat combat, Addictive items collection mentality.Replayability: 6/10 New Game Plus (NG+) Is not what it was in previous games. But with multiple quest lines and endings, worth a replay for the truly devoted.Price to pay: Game: About 30-50$ (USD) Season Pass: Unknown, No DLC released at time of writing.Estimated time to finish: About 40-120 Hours for average/casual gamers.I finished the first playthrough of the game with almost exactly 81 hours on my first character at level 109. This being said, it was not a true 100% run, as I messed up many quests, And even restarted after a 41 hour character had made some royal mistakes that caused the entire gameâs progression to be unsatisfactory with my standards. There are 3 endings that i know of, and to get all 3 expect about 20-40 hours per playthrough after your first.Key Notes/Warnings:Be wary of Keyboard and Mouse. This game does much better than past installments of using these to play, but you will truly enjoy this game on a different level with a controller.Be prepared to use  a guide for the game. The good gamers at darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com have put an astoundingly well done wiki-togeather that has guides on every item of the game, from the mundane to the extrodinary. Online play is sometimes hard to connect to. (I suspect this will become better latter as the popularity fades.) âDeath Ahead! therefore, Try resignation.â You Will Die. Alot. Be prepared to lose your souls over, and over, and be prepared to call for help from both guides and co-op players. But be wary, those you call to help may infact harm you by making your game appealing to those with a dark heart seeking to kill those who would so boldly try to kill the lords of cinder.Target gamer: Action-RPG Fans who don't mind using a controller. The game has everything most RPG fans crave, If you like RPGs, then this is a game that I suggest you try.The Short Version:Great game; With unique World, NPCs, Foes. Very Difficult for first time players, And thoroughly enjoyable as the rewards for every single action feel visceral, as if you can truly put yourself in the shoes of your character. The downsides are that this game is indeed so hard you will likely fail all of your NPC quest lines without some form of help, and even with help you may still fail due to some bugs creeping in.Pros:Good game length for money spent.Easy to use, hard to master combat styles. Decent sense of accomplishment and failure, Actions feel like they matter.Absolute tons of loot, weapons, gear, and thus a multitude of play styles.The Co-Op is rewarding and enjoyable, And the PVP is just as much so for the most part.Cons:Poorly Ported controls all but demand you have a controller. (Still the best souls yet in this regard)Buggy quest lines may cause characters with many, many, hours into their development to fail quests even if the user has done nothing wrong.Other Key Notes/Features:Unique Messaging system can leave you laughing, scratching your head, or simply shaking your head with a sigh.Unique take on Co-Op and PVP in an otherwise single-player focused world and game.Deep, but obscured lore. If you have the eye and mind for it, you can uncover an entire hidden world of strife.The Long Version: In the Dark Souls World there is no element more fleeting than the flame. Powerful beyond measure, and as fragile and fleeting as life in this world of the undead and horrors beyond reason. That being said, the game is as frustrating as it is rewarding. The rollercoaster of achievements, and failures is one you will have to ride at your own peril as one moment you're cursing at a boss made of bits and bytes of data, And the next, you are awe-stuck by your achievement of said bossâ demise at your hand, sending a very real dose of dopamine coursing through your veins as is the proverbial crack-like nature of this game. Immense, souls soaring(literally) highs, and deep, soul crushing(literally) lows.Dark Souls Is pretty, It is graphic, And above all else, it is a tale of tragedy, as if you look into the lore, you will find nothing but ruin, and pain. And so it mirrors this obscured misery unto itâs players making them through fits of rage, and bouts of depression when they die, and eventually lose those hard earned souls. But let's stop for a moment and reflect; Is it really the game that is difficult, or is it really a case of knowledge being the key to all of your problems? Case and point, The first boss; I was having a hell of a time fighting it when i first started. And iâll admit, i was never the best souls player, but i enjoyed it enough that i kept at it. On my 12th attempt my friend made mention of a slight fact, that the boss mimicked the fighting style of a previous boss. Knowing the boss in question from Dark Souls 1, i put to use my new found information and on my 13th time at the boss, I managed to kill it without using a single health potion because I understood it now.This game does not hold your hand, And should you allow someone else to hold your hand, you will rob yourself of the true joy of this game, Which is discovering your own potential rather than riding on the research and insight of others.âDie well my friend, your souls, shall not be wasted.â ~Jes McDevlin: From the fight with Sif in Dark Souls 1+Rep if you know Sifâs whole story and why he was one of the most tragic bosses in DS."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 13, 2016              I'm going to start and say, I love Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and even Bloodborne. I recommend this game, I do.But this review addresses everything wrong with the game as a sequel. This is a review for fellow Souls fans.Dark Souls 3 is, straight up, the easiest Souls game created. Anyone can beat it. Even the most inept of players won't hit a wall, they'll eventually tear through it. The difficulty of this game pales in comparison to Demon's Souls, to Dark Souls, to Dark Souls 2, and to Bloodborne by a massive amount. It's possible even some casual players will find themselves never losing their souls to a second death.Many enemies, from across the series, come up as a huge wall to players. You learn their movements, and tear through them after putting in the time and work. Trying to work around them can even end in great disaster. The only enemy that really puts up a fight can be the Lotrhic Knights, but not because of their difficulty, because of their damage and that is all. They are defeated without effort: spamming light attacks will keep them staggered. And after that, there are no more hard enemies. Not one in the game. You are set on by nothing but hollows who sluggishly move, and the very rare semi-competent skeletons. Anything much harder.. is solved by a gimmick.A giant worm that would otherwise be a horrible fight can be killed using a giant ballista. One of the bosses has a weapon specifically for him to kill him fairly quickly, much like the Storm Ruler from Demon's Souls. The hardest bosses (The Dancer, Champion Gundyr) are dispatched with not even well timed rolling and a few hits to their backside.But worse than that, the levels are not just short, but there's very few.. and most are very, very bland. While Dark Souls 1 was applauded for having a fantastically designed map, all of it interconnected and much of it unique, Dark Souls 2 was somewhat more traditional though still had some connections but was given far more unique locations, such as mining operations, a lava flooded castle, a castle drowned in rain, a quiet lake littered with fireflies and glowing fauna, dark labs, dragon's nests, and then the DLC areas were astounding. Dark Souls 3 is purely linear and only about half the total size of Dark Souls 2, every area was more bland. A somewhat interesting cemetery, a bland not-so-special castle aside from hollows who could only half way become pilgrim butterflies, bland forest with set pieces from DS1 for nostalgia, dull catacombs, a completely dull poison swamp, a lousy prison, a boring revist of Oolacile, a mostly uninteresting library... The most interesting areas of Dark Souls 3 are far from unique, capturing very little of the creativity of DS1 and DS2 with areas like Blighttown, the Painted World of Ariamas, New Londo Ruins, The Gutter, Majula, Shrine of Amana, Dark Chasm of Old, Brume Tower, Eleum Loyce... This isn't even half of the unique locales that were indeed quite enjoyable to look at, and the most unique location Dark Souls 3 has to offer is Kiln of the First Flame, an area that takes all of fifteen seconds to cross.And part of the world is the characters. While Greirat and Siegward are at least nice to talk to, everyone else is all but forgettable, and you rarely see them still. You don't talk to and regret meeting Lautrec, you don't feel as if you're following along on a grand journey like you did with Solaire (though you do stumble into Siegward just like before), you don't meet a character who asks you to kill -everyone- else, you don't meet some old king who tells you all of his regrets... You just meet people who are interested in selling stuff to you, and the obligatory Patches encounter.And then there's weapon balance. Much like other games, some weapons are better than others, but this time around, some weapons are leagues better than others compounded by the fact Poise is purely a disabled stat this time around (read again if you need to, Poise does nothing in Dark Souls 3 and has been confirmed as intentional). The Dark Sword, for instance, is a low weight of 4.5, and does a damage per second that completely outclasses nearly every weapon in the game with the correct build. The Spiked Mace can be built in a way that it will one shot players without any sort of parry. And Tower Shields are practically impossible to counter in PvP, and can attack while blocking far more effectively than a spear and shield torgether would be.On top of the poor weapon balance and Poise removed, invading players are at an extreme disadvantage: with reduced health, halved Estus rounded down, and primarily only invading players with phantoms, each invasion results in one of a few ways: the invader gets greedy and goes to them, and gets stuck fighting two players at once, the invader sits and waits by monsters for the next half hour because the host is too afraid for the odds to be evened despite still having more Estus, the invader finds a gank squad just for killing players already at a disadvantage, or the host doesn't know what they're doing and just runs out wildly and gets himself killed not even by you but some accident or monster.Or, if you're particularly unlucky, you'll run into a hacker. They take far less damage than they should at their level? They're modded their stats to be much higher without raising their level. They kill you in one hit? A hacker. There is even the ability to turn completely invisible, or fly, alter weapons to work how they want... This is nothing new to Souls, oh no. In DS1, hackers had the ability to instantly curse others with one hit of their weapon, even crash their game or rapid fire Firebombs. This time around, hackers can actually hit you with something that rapidly gives you souls and gets you, the invader, or even the host, banned out of nowhere. The solution to this: manual save backups because there are no cloud saves. The only solution currently. And the hacker problem is much worse than DS2, as Soul Memory made it hard to peg down for hackers where to be in that total to appropriately â¥â¥â¥â¥ over others.. but could get banned if they had more souls than soul memory as a counter.In short: Dark Souls 3 is the worst game of the Souls series. While people ripped on DS2 for a long time being worse than DS1, DS3 is worse than DS2 by a long shot in size, balance, quality of level design, PvP, and most importantly, difficulty.It's just too damn easy."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 7, 2017              Dark Souls IIIby someone who thinks they know how to criticise gamesDisclaimer: I haven't bought either DLCs and neither intend to.Gameplay and Combatas of the three games of what fans call  souls  series I've played, that being the three dark souls games(four if you count II and Scholar as separate games) this one has the best combat by far, not the most strategy based or complicated one, but the most exciting by far, it's fast and action packed with a lot of items/spell management mid-combat, rolling is thankfully back to dark souls 1 style, as in: there's a lot more frames of invincibility and even better you can use up to 70% of your carrying capacity and still roll with full invincibility frames, there are a satisfiable number of weapons in the game and they're now made unique by an ability system wich defines a special move each can use when you're holding 'em with both hands. Enemies now are WAAAAY more fun to battle against, there are a ton of different enemies each with their own moves and it doesn't feel like you're battling the same guy with different armor each time, that also goes for the bosses wich are really different from each other and are always a good challenge. That all said it is still to difficult, and it's a shame the game does not let you play it on an easier difficulty, there is so much to see and experience on the game that is locked behind an motor coordination barrier and it's a bummer, same goes for a pause button if you're not playing online, doesn't hurt and I hate to have to dies just because I've received an important message that must be replied to asapGraphics and Level designI played the game on windowed mode, resolution of 800x450 and the other options on the lowest setting possible(so I could run 60fps stable) and even then, I couldn't bring myself to kill one of the bosses ([spolier]Nameless king[/spolier]) because its area ran likeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ two or three places were awful to get trough because they ran at 15 fps max.The level design, although not as well planned as the first game is at least not as inconsistent as the second game, mostly all areas of the game are connected(but sadly not interconnected) and do a great job to move you from point A to B without getting you lost or confused on where to go, on every level/board/stage there is a lot to look out too, across the map there will be hints about the world and character sprinkled across, that's what makes the level design so great, the first game had huge areas that were mostly empty, but with the powerhouse of consoles nowadays from can fill that empty with a lot more thing to do and find.Sound designalthough boss themes are far from dull there is no music on most parts of the game, some could say that the decision was made so it would no affect the immersion, but they're wrong, well crafted music can only enhance the experience, that said the few tracks there are on the game are all awesome, bosses have distant music and they feel unique compared to the other games."

There's no options to customise key-bindings and the default keyboard controls are seemingly placed at random allover the board, while some aren't there at all.As it is, I can't recommend this game to a PC user, as many PC users, like me, would be expecting to play with their standard PC setup.I attempted to play on, using keyboard/mouse, as I assumed I'd better able to, but I was unable to git gud enough."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 30, 2017              Dark Souls 3 is, hands down, one of the best game i've ever played. The massive amount of coustimization that there is in this game is a big part of it. You can start out with one of many character types, and change your approach on what your character specializes in throughout the game. Every single fight has so much more life to them than in any of the other souls games. And the fact that the environments flow together so well adds to that experience in combat. Dark souls 3 is not nearly as frustrating as any other souls game, but at the same time it is more difficult AND more fun than any other souls game. I'm not saying that this game isn't frustrating, there is a good chance that you will have that moment where you will rage quit and send your controller sailing into the wall. Though I have not done that, it surley is tempting at times. This game's replay value makes up for it's flaws in every way, those flaws being difficulty spikes and NPC invaders that are extremely overpowered later on. Even after I beat the game and new game plus, I still wanted to go back and start a new game with a different character type and see how it played out differently for me. This game origionally took me 35 hours to beat  WITHOUT Archdragon Peak, the Consumed King's Garden OR any of the DLC's. This was because I kept trying to find new ways to fight and level myself up. I guess you could say... the game isn't hollow! Terrible puns aside, here is my rating: Praising the Sun/10, best game ever. Now prepare to die, a lot, For the fifth time in From Software's series."

After a 10-15 hour, i felt that i need to complete this game.After i completed the game, i felt i need to complete this game again, and locate all the secrets and lore.After i completed the game twice, i felt that i need to buy the dlc's coz i didnt get enough from this game(from the positive side ofc).After this monologe you can realize that how much i love this game now.Just to be fair!Positive thing:- Wonderful graphics- Nice combat system- So many different enemies with different combat style- Epic boss battle's- Good lore- Great co-op experience (even if the co-op system is not working at all the time for me)- Very-very good rpg system- Beutiful musicThere is no negative.

This game is pretty fun and as someone who is new to the series and sucks, beating the first boss made me feel my heart beating. Thats how good it was. This game is hard. If you're not up for a challenge then this game is not for you. I was skeptical about this game at first, but now i'm hooked.

        "Comments": "Posted: May 7, 2016              There is a worrying number of overly biased reviews for this game - as is the case with steam reviews in general.The single player is an experience that sums up the souls series in a very climactic way. It's definitely the most fine-tuned and visually striking souls game to date. The base-game is superb, there are a few secret area's that are rather large and diverse, and the items and weapons are sharp, interesting, and nicely balanced... for the most part (ESTOC-BESTOC). Armors are varied and tend to mix well together, I would have to say, fashion souls is now better than ever. The bosses are amazing, all of them. The first boss is a great introduction to the games difficulty and mechanics. A specific optional boss is honestly one of the best souls fights of all time, and one of the most challenging. Lore is one of my favorite aspects of a souls game, and this game has some very very interesting characters and bosses, my particular favorite being Aldrich, the devourer of gods, he's a total scumbag.pvp is definitely the thing that needs to change the most. There are hackers who are causing concern for players, but before you post a negative review, might I recommend a counter-measure, or at least, a fail-safe to prevent irreversible damage. Backup your saves !!! It's as simple as that. Sure, it's a nuisance, but it's more preferable than losing your character completely. I can assure you, from is not ignoring it.I'd like to remind you, pvp was pretty bad in Dark souls 2 when it came out. Only after many updates did it become balanced and fun - give dark souls 3 the same patience, there are new mechanics and changed concepts -- it'll take some time, but it'll be fixed.This game is not as bugged or as laggy as so many people seem to claim. I run a 960 on high and get 60 in all areas of the game - note, I do run a higher end processor, so your fps may vary. I don't know if From is offering a fix for other, less optimized cards, but I can assure you, this is not a halfâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥effort for a port, the devs have discussed with the community the problems and bugs people are experiencing within the game, and their acknowledgement alone means they're willing to work on fixing these problems. This game is worth your time, Fromsoft is a pretty good developer - if you don't want to risk buying due to the lag or PvP problems, give it some time, it'll fix itself out over time."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 29, 2016              Let me Preface with thisI am a huge fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, (I've sunk well over 1k hours into each) I have played the second DS and didn't like it (Big suprise) and was looking forward to this one with optimisim and was hugely dissappointed Dark Souls 3 Is unbalancedI feel as if I am playing an early build where tweaking and rebalancing is in its early stages,Keep in mindI have multiple max all stat (all 99) characters I went to NG+9 and invested many hours into this game(Note I do not have very much PVP experience but I do have some. I am mostly reffering to Offline play in this review)1) Poise is non existant and worthless.Poise was a major factor in combat in DS 1. It allowed you to take hits without being staggered; if you had a high enough poise value. This allowed you to effectively trade blows with Mobs and Players. You could initiate an attack and not be staggered during the animation. Hyper armor is present in DS3 but it's situational at best. This leads to stunlock gameplay. The best/ultimate/only viable strategy for PvE is to equip all light armor and a weapon with good range and wide sweeping attacks to stagger every enemy in the vacinity and stun lock all of them. I.E. in the Boreal valley I used all light armor and the Wolf knight Great Sword to stagger ever enemy encounter before they staggered me and I got through the area unscathed. However if I tried to use heavier armor and trade blows I would loose everytime. So why bother using heavy armor at all? This brings up two more issues. Sheilds being useless, and enemy aggression/overall combat pacing.2)Shields. Sheilds have alway been a very usefull offensive and defensive item in previous souls games. The ability to throw up a shield and block an attack was invaluable. Enemy's blows could bounce off your shield and staggr your opponent creating an opening for you. Depending on the sheild taking a blow would not consume much stamina. However in DS3 I was onlyable to take 2 or 3 hits before my gaurd was broken on most normal sheilds. Thiswouldn't be a problem if the enemies werent so aggressive, but more on thatlater. The offensive side to sheilds in previous souls games in the Parry/Riposte Mechanic which also suffers in this game. I mastered Parrying in DS1 and as a result I could combat most enemies no problem. However in this game the parrying is almost entirely luck based. Enemies swing so quickly parrying is very difficult to perform. Especially when enemies have multi hit combos. Combined with the lack of poise and the stamina cosumed in blocking, screwing up a parry can cost you a fight. Great sheilds are also usless. They too consume a great amount of stamina when blocking attacks leading to frequent guard breaks. 3) Enemy AggressionThis is more of a personal opinion but I feel it still holds weight. Enemies are much more aggressive than they have ever been in a souls game. many enemies have multihit combos that result in the player being stunlocked due to the lack of poise. blocking does not help because your guard breaks easily. Rolling is the only efficient method to combat. Armor and sheilds are way to underpowered to deal with the aggressive enemies of DS3All of these issues lead to only one viable playstyle. Light rolling, and heavy weapons. Using Heavy armor is pointless as it yields no benefit. Shields can only block a few attacks at best before your guard is broken so why bother with them. The lack of poise leads to a stunlock gameplay. It feels as if I am playing bloodborne with a Souls skin. From should have made another bloodborne since they obviously wanted to4)Map designWhat is porbably my favorite design feature of DS 1 was the intricate map design. The waps were wooven together vertically which allowed for shortcuts and hidden passage ways. it was really interesting to explore the map and see how it folded back in on itself and how it flowed. Just the oter day I was playing DS 1 through again and I noticed that you can see Lost Izalith from the Tomb of The Giants bonfire. It made the map feel titly knit and jammed packed. Being forced to explore the map and every nook and cranny due to the inability to fast travel early on made me very familliar with themap. I now have it memorizeed like the back of my hand and can navigate it very quickly. However DS3 is rather linear. The map doesnt come together and suprise you like DS1 did. Its not a major issue I'm Just dissappointed slightly5) Hub WorldDS2 and 3 adopted a HUB approach to the game design. they forced you to return to a certain area to level up, upgrade weapons, and to purchase items. While in DS3 merchants, blacksmiths, andbonfires were all over the map. You could all your weapon upgrading, repairs, and leveling up from any bonfire. This allowed the game to flow and didnt interupt the exploration at all. Instead of warping back to a HUB and going through multiple loading screens just to level up I could instead do it all at a bonfire. This made my journey feel much more personal and lonely which really helped deliever the atmosphere of lonliness that Dark Souls nailed perfectly.The game does have some pluses however. It is visually stunning Some of the bossfights are fantastice. The music is top notchPvP from what I played is reasonably fun despite the many balancing issuesThe enviorments, while linear, are gorgeous and intterestingIt has interesting endingsthe Quests are fun and rewardingVoice acting is stellar"

        "Comments": "Posted: June 4, 2016              (This is all based on my own OPINION)Dark Souls 3 is a Hard game, that breaks off then the easy RPG.It never tells you were to go, and it sure as hell doesn't give you an easy time when you get to the place you need to be. When I first started playing, it took me around 3 Hours to actually defeat (STARTING BOSS SPOILERS AHEAD) Ludex Gundyr, and Vordt, then make it over to the next area, I think I made 3-4 different characters to defeat Ludex, because I needed those Firebombs to kill Ludex Gundyr, thankfully. My friend(s) started to help me through the game once I got near the First Lord of Cinder, I've completed the game over 7 times now, I'm always trying different builds and seeing if I enjoy it or not.Most of my play time now, instead of trying to complete the game again, is helping out other players, and PvPing. (And praising that I don't get into a fight club) Some people you find are fun to play with. Constantly chucking down  Hello  Carvings, and doing Gestures, Whilst others don't even Gesture before going into a Boss Fog, or slicing you to Death.A few times I've gotten a good laugh out of some people. I was once invaded someone, and they looked like a Phantom (Due to using a Ring) I waited a bit nearbye, and then walked over, he did a Gesture to look like he was Resting at the Bonfire, he Waved. I did  My Thanks! , I used the Bloodlust Katana to stab myself, and rest. Whilst doing that. I realised that the Bonfire wasn't lit, so I wanted to be kind, and wait for the Host to come. He constantly pointed at the Unlit bonfire, and so did I. He brang out his Bloodlust Katana and started to stab himself to do Death. I clapped constantly, he kept going, and killed himself, a moment later. I see on my Screen  Host of Embers Destroyed! (TL;DR/etc. Is)Pros-Semi-Long game-Different to other RPG's-Tries very hard to keep secrets to other Areas-Hard game-Allows for all different kind of Playstyles.-Doesn't matter what Class you select at the near-end game once you've found most things.-Community is (most of the time) fun/funny to play with.-The Community is happy to help each other out (most of the time)-Addicting if you like the game itself-etc.Cons-Some OP weapons-Some Bugs that can pretty much one Hit something that can be Reposited-(For some people) the game not telling them to go can lead to frustration-Starting players will try to kill everything in there path, leading to the annoyance of dying to things much more powerful then you-(For some people) It is easy to not do one thing right, and that will lead to your Death-etc.Thanks for reading my Review. (Longest one I've done)Don't forget to Praise the MOON.Have a good Day. ^>^"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 5, 2016              Dark Souls has come full circle. From the niche beginnings with Demonsâ Souls all the way up to todayâs Dark Souls 3. What was once a game series reserved for the masochistic and patients players has grown to a brand that moves millions of games at the mere mention of its name. It has become mainstream. Is this bad? Maybe. Is this good? Maybe. Better production value and refinement are among the merits, but it is a Faustian embargo because the key element of a Souls game; its difficulty, is kind of lacking in Dark Souls 3.Booting DS3 sends you into familiar territory. A black screen, with the imposing letters once again awaits you as you slave for hours in character creation to avoid a complete farce. The introduction then sets the stage for this instalmentâs cryptic story. The world as we left it after Dark Souls 2 has burnt out to nearly nothing by ashes and the time has come to once again rekindle the first flame. However, it takes five carcasses these days to stoke the fires so you are called from beyond the grave with the express purpose of dragging four of the five deadbeats back to the fire and casting their dried husks into it to give people an extension on their drab and dreary world.      Itâs more of the same, and the lore and traditionally hidden plot development is leaning heavily on the original Dark Souls for its appeal. Frankly, the amount of DS1 pandering is so extreme that it makes the two or three concrete references in DS2 look tame. After having thoroughly established that kingdoms rise and fall in the sequel, part three throws all that plot development out of the window and returns to the source to bring alienated fans back. If you, like me, actually liked The Matrix Reloaded then youâll understand why this is a bad thing. After establishing a rich world with details, mythology and lore they forgo most of it just to shoehorn some of the old stuff back in there. When you look past the story youâll still find an incredibly solid and refined action role playing game that doesnât compromise on a single thing. The starting area guides you past easy enemies, different terrain types, your first bonfire and an enemy only the truly gutsy can tackle at that point. It doesnât take long before you meet your first boss which will either kick the living daylights out of you or youâll triumphantly destroy it on your first pass. What follows is a short hike to a building on the cliff where you enter the hub of this game: Firelink Shrine. Here youâll be given your purpose, a number of helpful NPCs and not a single proper hint that the bonfire in the centre will teleport you into the main game.       This first section is painstakingly crafted to teach you the fundamentals. Or not; if youâre a Demonsâ Souls veteran and have played all the other games youâll breeze through it like it was a different game. Unbeknownst to me, this had become the theme for my overall experience with DS3. After I went to the first area, a castle, I was greeted with hollows, knights, dogs and a dragon. However, none of them really presented an obstacle. Nor was the first boss, a quadrupedal knight with an ice club, much of a challenge if youâre used to playing a dodge build. This continued throughout the game. Most bosses only took me one or two tries to beat. If I used summons I didnât even have to try. I hardly ever got killed. Sure I died a few times in the Dragon Keep, and Knightslayer Tsorig sure knows how to earn his name, but I never felt in any way triumphant or relieved to have passed an obstacle or have beaten a boss. Returning to the game with a different build did give me a challenge eventually, but when playing like I usually do the game was kind of a breeze. If death is your teacher in Dark Souls, then I didnât learn much this time round. For all them memes and jokes made about its difficulty, DS3 doesnât live up to its predecessors reputation.DS3 may have lost a notch in difficulty, but it certainly has gained props in its level of quality. DS 2 was mired at first for its lack of polish. Sloppy hitboxes, poor level design, bland graphics and enemy design. DS3 has got none of that; it is an amazing accomplishment in level of refinement, presentation and interface design. Hitboxes are now perfectly implemented. You can vault through two swooping swords and land on the other side unscathed. Firebreath stops exactly where it seems to stop and a giantâs foot only stomps where it lands. This is a colossal improvement over 2âs dingy detection. The improvements donât end there. The game is gorgeous. Skyboxes create an amazing sense of scale while the miniscule details in the world make each area vibrant and alive (despite the fact that everything is dead). Capes and cloaks look absolutely gorgeous and you have all the options to make your character look truly stunning. The game runs excellently at 60fps at 1080p on a GTX970. FROM also made a considerable effort to make the regular enemies a lot more interesting. From your regular zombies to ravenous beasts, there are some incredibly creative designs. Some enemies are as challenging as bosses themselves, without being cheap like in DS2. Speaking of bosses, despite some of them being stupidly easy, a good number of them are still amazing. Iâd have to say that theyâre more cool than hard, but the hardest bosses in the game also happen to be the coolest. Imagine a pope with lightsabres, or an insanely intense fight against a dragon rider knight, without any gimmicks. These are the gameâs highlights and the moments where I enjoyed the game most. Not everything is perfect though. While a lot of systems have seen significant polish, quite a few enhancements that were introduced in DS2 were dropped along with its lore. The power stance in gone, replaced with special dual weapons; reducing the creative weapon matching to almost zero. Poise is gone; the game did away with it entirely; enemies still hit you through walls; new game+ is severely lacking in features; NPC quests are more vague than ever before and often end without warning. None of these issues are game breaking. The overall whole is extremely solid and amazingly well engineered. It is just so perplexing that many of the systemic improvements from DS2 were removed. I guess streamlining is the keyword here, but that still doesnât make up for the inability to wield two repeater crossbows.       Another massive gripe stems from PVP. The implementation of a password system to hook up with your friends is also extremely welcomes (seriously, this password system is the best thing since the white soapstone). However, the tweaks to PVP matchmaking are horrible. The game now biases invasions to intrude the world of a host with a phantom. That way, the invader has to face at least two, more powerful opponents, with a possible blue spirit joining the host to fend off the invader. Meanwhile, invaders can kill each other, despite pursuing the same goal. PVP is reserved to the truly committed invaders with the skill and ability to pull off these feats. After thirty hours the credits roll on what was to me the easiest Souls experience I had had up to that point. It was by no means a bad journey. It looks and runs amazingly, the combat is still fun and the online component runs like clockwork most of the time. It is refined to the point of perfection, but certain elements are up for debate in both terms of gameplay and plot. Without a doubt the best Dark Souls experience available on PC.This review was edited to fit the character count. Certain illustrations and elaborations were omitted. Feel free to ask questions."

Problems with PvP, like excessive healing and constant summons, requiring player run covenents to help fix this issue, and the interesting change to poise, which totally changed how the game was played compared to previous titles. That being said, Dark Souls 3 is a really well made game with a beautiful aesthetic. Performance is really solid and crashes have been so minimal that its been a very long time since I've had to deal with them, All in all, I'd definitely recommend this title"

I actually thought I would hate this game to its guts, but the hype from the fanbase was just too much. I decided to preorder and give it a shot. When I began playing the game on the first day, I struggled to use keyboard and mouse(A shame there is no kb/m overlay). As a result, I died many times and I kept struggling to actually attempt to enjoy the game. However, after many defeats and many dissatisfactions, I finally beat my first boss WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE! Now, I don't usually get hyped after completing a tutorial level, but this game was totally different. It didn't just give me some mindless skeletons to fight, but it also gave me a boss to fight, which by the way, gave me a headache.Each level was more enormous than the one before it with enemies that were sometimes huge. When I finally beat the game, I couldn't believe it was finally over. I was actually sad that there no more remaining bosses that could give me suffering and frustration. In my opinion, this game turned me into a masochist. Though, what the hell is up with all this weird English poetic stuff? Did the writers just read Shakespeare and decide to write in whatever word they thought had a good ring to it?10/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 7, 2016              Awesome game! Very challenging and different from many others. The only cons are that the server lags sometimes, online gaming glitches once in a while, and anti-cheating system is absolutely horrible. I would recommend anyone playing this game to back up their save files frequently. This can be done easily with a C++ backup software made by EntityZero on reddit. Just set up how frequently and how much back up files you want your save to be backed up, and keep it on while you play your game. It takes no processing power at all, all the program does is copy and paste your save file to another location every X minutes. You can also choose how much save to keep. Keeping 5 or more is recommended.Backing up can save you from a soft ban. For example, if you meet the hacker that gives you millions of souls, once you get hit, quit the game as quick as you can. Pull up your back up save and replace your ruined save. If you left the program on, the most recent save is probably corrupted also, so use the older one ( like 2 minutes older) just to be safe.Since your back up save is clean, the anti cheating system won't detect any invalid data, therefore you won't get bannedHere's the link for the program:https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4f02y7/dark_souls_2_3_auto_backup_tool/"

Great boss battles, challenging enemies, great scenarios, etc. The game itself hasnt changed much compared to its previous versions, but it stills feel pretty unique and the game mechanics have improved/evolved.Compared to older Dark Souls games:- Faster combat (movement feels a bit faster).- Casting and proyectile animations are MUCH faster.- Durability isnt an issue anymore.- Improved covenant system.- All weapons have skills/stances.If you liked previous DS titles this is a must buy.If you are willing to get immersed into the Dark Souls world for the first time, this is still a solid choice and be prepared to die a lot :)"

The large selection of weapons and armor. The subtle story telling and amazing atmosphere. Everything Dark Souls One had which made it great is found here, with better graphics, cool new bosses and more engaging questlines and choices. It may lack the genius connectivity that the original game had, but it also references bloodborne and Demon's Souls, so that's a plus. Way, way better than Dark Souls 2, I think this is the true sequel to One, and the proper ending the series needed. I'm really looking forward to seeing what From Software makes next, but I hope they do something very different. I would love to see where their twisted animation and beautiful designs could bring us."

You will die by a slash of a sword, by a slice-and-dice axe, by a bonecrushing hammer, or by a piercing spear; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls III. It is education, it is progress, it is the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in your gaming experience since forever â it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Because your chances of success seem so slim when first starting up a new game, each victory feels monumental and self-gratifying. The DLCs' are also great and thrilling to play through, and in my honest opinion also have some of the greatest and most arduous boss fights you will ever encounter in the Dark Souls series, but i'll let you decide on that matter. One of the most memorable experiences that I've ever been blessed by, therefore I shall rate this game 10 out of 10 finger but holes!"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 29, 2016               This review comes from a player who have never got banned or came across a hacker after more than 150h playtime  About the Reviewer  Overall Dark Souls Experience My name is Gal and I am a huge fan of the   Dark Souls  game searies. I strated playing the first game out of the three in 2013 and finished it twice (on PC and on XBOX 360). While playing  Dark Souls 1  I became obsessed with the game and loved every single thing about it. Then, in 2014  Dark Souls 2  was born and a new saga began to the  Dark Souls  searies. I have played the second game the second it came out and I finished it a week after, and to be honest, it wasn't a blast. I had fun time playing it, but it was just not like the first game.And then, Dark Souls 3  showed himself to the world in 2016........... Current State in Dark Souls 3 Finished the game about 4 times. Have 3 PvP players. Playing a lot of PvP, and trying to get more characters to level 120 (PvP Meta). My Opinion  First Cutcene When I launched the game for the first time I was so happy to go back into the world of  Dark Souls , the menu screen, the sounds, everything was exactly like good old  Dark Souls . Then, the first cutscene started (and with it the goosebumps ^^) and god.... oh god the voice acting in this game is just... SO GODDAMN GOOD! Already in the first cutscene you hear an old woman's voice telling you about the history of a place called  Lothric  and while hearing the woman's voice you see characters and lords that you know, you are going to meet and probably fight. First Gameplay and Boss Impression The gameplay starts, and you pick up your Ashen Flask after killing a bunch of dudes and then you light the first bonefire, wasn't so hard right? Meeting the first boss 2 second later gives you that breathtaking feeling that you are fighting against a gigantic armored guy that got some cool moves. After few tries you manage to take him down to half health and you see  phase 2 , and oh god, that is just terrifying!  Some dark creature is just cracking his way up from that guy  and you need to fight against it! After managing to take that thing down you fully walk into.... the world of Dark Souls 3! 40 Hours Into the Game You are geared up, got your own playstyle with unique swords and spells and you crawl deeper into the dark lore meeting up glorious and scary bosses. In your journey you get to choose things that will affect the end that you will get (  there are 3 endings to the game and another special end  ) and to be honest, on my first playthrough, I didn't knew what I was actualy picking (Blind playthrough) but at the end I figured it out. Overall Rating  Story: 8/10 -   I realy love the  Dark Souls  franchise lore (the things I know about it...) but I didn't like it so much how the developers delivered it in the third game. there are a lot of NPC questline that you most likely missed on your first playthrough and how the lore is being told... it is too foggy in my opinion. Sounds (Music and Voice Acting) : 10/10 -  The music in this game just matches so good into some situations and the voice acting is amazing. Gameplay and Mechanics  (Xbox 360 Controller) : 9/10 -  I realy enjoyed how the game is being played and the new weapon arts is just great. I was sad to see that they took down the dual wielding stance and some of the mechanics are just hiddin inside the game and you only realise them when watching a toutorial or by accident. PvP and Online Matchmaking: 8/10 -   Dark Souls 3  is the first Dark Souls game I started playing PvP and I having super fun with it. The problem is that some of the weapons are just not balanced enough and the hitbox can be a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥sometimes. Graphics and Sceneries: 10/10 -  The game looks great and most of the sceneries are so amazingly good (  Irithyll of the boreal valley  was just so beautiful ).This was my first review, hope you guys liked it :)"

The game is so perfect and complete and wholesome, that if you do beat the first boss (Many people give up and refund), then you're probably going to beat the game, although beating the game is very different from completing it.

Amazing detail in the level design. Lore is fascinating like the first installment. The weapon arts are really fun and encourage you to try all the weapons. Bosses will have your heart beating like crazy as you get to the end of their health bar. And the DLC ended up being some of the best add-on content money can buy."

        "Comments": "Posted: January 1, 2017               It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard... is what makes it great. Taking its cues from Bloodborne, the speed of play has been dramatically increased in this latest Dark Souls outing and combat is a lot more stressful and punishing than it was in the first two games too. Relative to a series renowned for its challenge, the earlier levels contribute to a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but souls (the currency that allows a player to gain items and improve their character's abilities) are kept in short supply and the hub area where they can be spent is locked away until a player  graduates  from the first boss fight.Whereas the bosses are comparable to previous games in terms of difficulty, they're almost upstaged by the regular enemies who attack with heightened speed and aggression at every opportunity. Long gone are the lumbering knights and club-wielding underlings of Dark Souls II, here you're frequently accosted by bizarre horrors including crystalline beasts, demented stat-reducing jailers, and crazed demons that will literally try to rip your character's head off!Aside from new features like the smart skill system and some welcome changes to how magic behaves, Dark Souls III is very reminiscent of past games in the series. The story concerns the four Lords of Cinder whose departure has plunged the cursed Kingdom of Lothric into chaos. Players take on the mantle of the Ashen One and must return the Lords - or at least their heads - to their  moulding thrones  so that the undead curse can be averted once and for all.Fans of the series will be glad to know that Dark Souls III does not sell out on the qualities that have made it so successful and admired up until now. The gameplay is still tense, the environments still inspire awe, and the fragmented tapestry that makes up the game's narrative will take many hours of decrypting in order to knit together.There are elements that feel a bit tired; it's only natural after so many sequels, but it's commendable how successful FromSoftware has been in trying to keep the series feeling fresh and exciting. The boss battles are an especially good example of this. Improving on the mediocre confrontations that characterized much of Dark Souls II, here the actual number of bosses is reduced in favour of providing more honed and interesting confrontations. Dark Souls III has bosses that set a new high for the series and each one is very different in look and execution. The variety here is bolstered by several good commonalities including interesting arena design, superb backing music, and dynamic move sets.Dark Souls III does well to introduce some circuitous level design towards the end and even though the more linear approach in the first half is focused and effective, it's fair to say that those expecting another vast and interconnected world like the one from Dark Souls are probably going to feel a tinge of disappointment. That's not to say that this is a small game though as you'll find Lothric to be a huge place that's absolutely brimming with enemies to slay and secrets to find. It may not be as vast as Drangleic was in Dark Souls II, but Lothric does feel more packed with content and it's a rare area indeed that doesn't feature a satisfying verticality to it.In terms of this PC version specifically, Dark Souls III is a success beyond words when compared to the ports of previous entries. The 60FPS action is fluid, the graphics are sharp, and the loading screens are so short that item descriptions will disappear before you can even finish reading them! Conversely though, there is a tendency for the game to pause slightly when picking up items and it sometimes has trouble streaming certain areas; blocking them off behind unsightly fog barriers until they finish loading. The environments are still well designed - you can expect to see plenty of  gorgeous views ahead  - although the game as a whole is rather grey in appearance and it can be easy to miss areas and NPCs because of how well they blend into their surroundings.My time with the PC version was smooth sailing on the whole though and I can only hope that future software updates help those players who have reported crashes and related bugs during the launch period.In terms of performance, it's important to state how well this game plays with regards to its multiplayer too. Whilst Dark Souls was more experimental and arguably ill-suited to serious cooperative/competitive play, the series as a whole has always been too good not to share and FromSoftware have taken steps to further improve the network code for this new release. Players can still summon human-controlled phantoms to assist in clearing out levels and bosses and the number of permitted players in each host's world has been boosted for more team-based insanity than ever before.Multiplayer has been a very strong focus for FromSoftware this time around and it really shows. The disastrous soul memory feature from Dark Souls II has been axed in favour of simple matchmaking rules (including a glorious password system for friends) that eliminate a lot of the undue frustration associated with summoning other players. The realms of PvP and PvE feel closely intertwined in Dark Souls III. Estus healing is quicker, combat is more nuanced, and you'll likely find a deluge of summoning signs and invaders in every new area that you visit.Whether they're the hostile red phantoms that want nothing more than to kill you, the gold phantoms that want to earn medals for helping you, or the mysterious purple phantoms (God only knows what they want) entering your world, the potential for player interaction is off the charts.FromSoftware has acted to make sure that players feel more secure in general though and Dark Souls III seems to be more protective of its PvE players as a result. Likely an attempt to curb trolling, red phantoms seem to be regularly, if not exclusively matched up with  victims  who have already summoned helpers into their world. In this way it seems that player invasions have lost some their non-hardcore appeal as a red phantom will frequently find themselves staring down multiple foes instead of just one. There are fewer easy kills to be had in this game that's for sure.There are signs of franchise fatigue, most noticeably in the number of callbacks and references to previous games in the series. At times the setting in Dark Souls III risks losing its sense of identity and becoming that of a mere nod to the first Dark Souls. Whilst a subtle musical cue or visual reference does hit the mark from time to time, there are too many revelations in this game that failed to surprise me because I found it easy to anticipate what was going to be another tribute.It's impossible to feel unsatisfied with Dark Souls III as a complete package though and you can easily expect a 50+ hour initial playthrough if you're committed to searching every nook and cranny the game has to offer. The game has its lesser points, but none of them are severe enough to stop it from being a fitting end to what is perhaps the greatest trilogy of video games there has ever been.Much like the motif of fire and embers; a visual that permeates the game's bosses and locations as much as it does your player character, there's a certain warmth about Dark Souls III. It's a familiar resplendence found in the sweaty grip of the controller after slaying a towering boss, so too is it found in the game's deep backstory, its beautiful environments and the mystery behind its many secrets and hidden endings. The developers may have gotten a little nostalgic for this entry sure, but I'll be damned if they didn't earn the indulgence.Read the full review at my blog Â»[www.celjaded.com]"

I bet it's safe to buy now, yet always keep in mind, that you do NOT want to take gifts from people you haven't met, and don't trust.Please note this review will be positive once the anti-cheat is fixedI'm not the type which puts a lot of effort into his reviews, but I'll say what's on my mind.So overall this is the greatest milestone in the Souls series. However, it's also the most troubled version of all the Souls games.Yes.. We're talking about hackers. Now, it's nothing new with hackers on the PC platform, however what's been going on with DS3 lately is ridicolous. I'd like to refer to my thread at the steam discussions for more information about this.The atmosphere and general sound, is amazing. Especially the atmosphere. Have you heard the Firelink music? It's awesome, go look it up on Youtube. Now, now. I'm not much in this game for the sounds ofcourse, as it's the gameplays (and partly the graphics?) that really matters to me.The gameplay is solid, and is challenging like you'd expect from a Souls game. I personally don't feel like it's the hardest there's been, but that may be because it's not my first Souls experience anymore. What I find most astounding, is the online play (except for the mentioned hackers and modders), which consists of you, and other people being able to both invade, summon and being summoned into other worlds as phantoms. My 64 hours in this game, is mostly consisting of PvP. The variety and fun you can have, finishing a PvP build, and then wrecking havoc in other host's worlds is really great.Now, is the PvP balanced? No, and you probably wouldn't be able to name one game which has perfect balancing. however, From is doing a good job at trying to patch, when someone finds, and exploits an insanely good combo/weapon.That's it. Not a great review, but I don't really have more time to write this now.One last thing: Please for the love of god, don't pick up items from a person whom you find highly suspicious, or have seen hack. This may get you banned. To combat this ridicolous anti-cheat, do regular back-ups."

I've played the first 15 hours with absolutely no issues, bugs, or crashing at all. It ran at a constant 60fps and looked and played lovely. I only started having issues when I reached the second bonfire at the Road of Sacrifice. I literally cannot load there or the game completly crashes. No one has any real fixes for the issue, I've tried them all the possible one that players have come up with. No help from FromSoftware, they don't even seem to have acknowledged this crashing issue that multitudes of people have had. I'd love to continue to  git gud  but I can't really progress for fear my game is gonna keep crashing over and over (which could make me banned from online play!!). 10/10 game but 1/10 port"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 7, 2016              Awesome game! Very challenging and different from many others. The only cons are that the server lags sometimes, online gaming glitches once in a while, and anti-cheating system is absolutely horrible. I would recommend anyone playing this game to back up their save files frequently. This can be done easily with a C++ backup software made by EntityZero on reddit. Just set up how frequently and how much back up files you want your save to be backed up, and keep it on while you play your game. It takes no processing power at all, all the program does is copy and paste your save file to another location every X minutes. You can also choose how much save to keep. Keeping 5 or more is recommended.Backing up can save you from a soft ban. For example, if you meet the hacker that gives you millions of souls, once you get hit, quit the game as quick as you can. Pull up your back up save and replace your ruined save. If you left the program on, the most recent save is probably corrupted also, so use the older one ( like 2 minutes older) just to be safe.Since your back up save is clean, the anti cheating system won't detect any invalid data, therefore you won't get bannedHere's the link for the program:https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4f02y7/dark_souls_2_3_auto_backup_tool/"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 13, 2016              Thank you FromSoftware; as a bored adult gamer, youâve brought the real joys of gaming to me once again.TL;DR: Been getting bored of games fairly quickly in the last few years and didnât seem to have much attention span for most. Then bought Dark Souls 3 when it came out as my first ever Souls game in the series, got massively hooked and felt the real joys of gaming again. Bought the other 2 as well as a PS4 so I could play Bloodborne and now Iâm a complete addict!I have been a gamer since I remember, and now in my early 30âs, for the past few years, I found myself getting bored of games very quickly. From AAAâs to indie games Iâd mostly end up playing them just so I can beat them and be done with them so I could move on to the next title, like ticking chores off a list, and quite often not even bother finishing the game at all (Iâm sorry The Divinity, you were one of the better games I played recently!)Iâd known about the Soul games for years, but had been hesitant to even try them for fear of frustration and boredom from their infamous difficult gameplay and the countless deaths phenomena. Until a few months ago I saw an interesting video that delved deep into the Soul gamesâ sense of exploration, and the rewarding factor of the games - something I truly realised later on when I played the games - so i decided to pick up Dark Souls 3 upon its release a couple of months ago. After countless hours of frustration and deaths (as expected), I realised I must be doing something wrong; I may not be a real hardcore gamer, but surely I canât be that bad? Thatâs when I decided to read up on the games mechanics, stats system, guides on how to play as a noob, what starter class to pick, guides on parrying and so on and on and on. So I started a new game, picked up a knight and started to play properly. Never have I ever found myself so immersed in a game in such a long long time. I invested so much time in the game, not only by playing, but also reading up about every bit of the game - something that Iâd barely and rarely done with any game before, unless it was a little walkthrough through some section of some game I was stuck at or some such. I studied the maps and made sure I missed not a single item. I read up on all different NPCâs and quest lines to make sure Iâd make the most of the play-through, something I realised later wasnât possible to achieve in just one play-through. So not so shockingly, I started the NG+ once I beat the game so I can achieve 100% achievement completion: an idea that I wouldâve laughed off at in any previous games that Iâd played. âWho gives a damn about achievements? Nonetheless, I loved this game so much I bought the kickstarter board game and the other 2 Soul games in the series, which Iâm yet to play because I ended up buying a PS4 (that came with Uncharted4) just so I can play Bloodborne. Yes, Iâm really that much affected (read: obsessed) by these games. And Bloodborne: what an utterly gorgeous game. Itâd probably come as to no surprise at this rate to say that I even ordered the gameâs guidebook, to save myself from countless amounts of internet checking (which I still do anyway!). I could write a long post about how amazing this game is but Iâll save that for another time!So thank you again FromSoftware for making some of the most amazing games in all my years of gaming experience, and bringing back the joys of gaming again to this bored-no-more adult gamer. My wallet may hate your guts, but I love you."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 5, 2016              Dark Souls III is without a doubt the best entry in the trilogy of games. Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.* PlotDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic  praise the sun!!!!  stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.* DesignDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.*EDIT*After discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.* GameplayThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each  normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.* PresentationMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other teâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥al problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.*OverallDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.8.1/10> Pros-Excellent design-beautiful world-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay> Cons-patronizing design in many places-technical issues-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you"

Only if youre a person whos into  games with many mechanics to fidget with.....I got introduced to this game through the Dragon Age games since the weapon upgrades were equally as important and survival depended on top notch management of your gear of you and your party. Be prepared to experiment as when something doesnt work youll have to be adaptable enough to use everything the game gives you at your disposal at that given moment.Most importantly, Dark Souls is not hard as long as you realize that you are suppose to fail to figure out what works and what doesnt. Once you get that through your head, youll have alot of fun actually instead of frustration."

The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel... bland.Overall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now... which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked."

You can fail hundreds of times, countless hours gone. But with each attempt you get a little closer to success. A little bit closer to understanding why you may be looking at a situation the wrong way, why you can't just go all in at once and expect to win. It also shows you that there are so many others stuck in the same way you are, each feeling lost - each on the border of going hollow.  I could write for days to explain everything I've learned from this game. Know this, you won't regret buying or playing, but you may just find your own flame along the way."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 7, 2017              Okay, I have been struggling, that's for sure. And even if I really want to give this game a negative review... I just can't, it feels wrong.This was my first Dark souls game ever, and boy did I underestimate it. I first purchased this game to myself and as a gift to a friend. A third friend said that this game was very difficult which resulted in alot of... Rage. I've always wanted to see the friend I gifted the game to rage and it was so worth it, even if he did not even make it through half of the game.As for me... It took a while to say in the least. I felt awful as I struggled with the first boss... It was the most terrible feeling in the world and I felt so bad that I just felt ashamed when I finally killed the bastard. Moving through the game, the Dark soul veteran of my friends gave me a weapon which he told me would be fun to use. So I used my remaing souls to get past the minimum requirments of the weapon so I could use it effectively. He was right, it was freaking hilarous, it was awesome. Or atleast until the weapon started to suck because I could'nt upgrade the damn thing but it did not matter, I made a promise to complete the game with it and I intended to keep that promise.A moment I will describe is when I came to Aldrich, devourer of gods. It's my favorite boss in the game and at the moment, the series as a whole. I struggled quite alot with this one, more than the other lords of cinder. Because let's face it... When Aldrich hits his second form and you're out of stamina... I just loved the boss fight with the different mechanics such as the ranged magic attacks, bow and arrow, teleport and the swift dash with the staff like spear. I don't know, I just loved the fight so much to the point that I placed a summon sign outside the boss to help others instead of making a new character.Another great moment was when I summoned two of my friends to aid me in the fight against Lothric and Lorian. I had recently bought Knight Artorias helmet and I was looking for a fitting outfit. My friends gladly shared some of their different armor sets so that I could find my  fashion souls.  It only took me about 10 minutes and I felt awesome afterwards. I had only worn the fallen knight outfit before and it was nice to have something new to look at. But what was even more awesome was the moment when we were going to fight the boss fight, the three of ous all togheter. It felt more fun than than the previous boss fights. To have two guys charge some shady looking princes with the third one standing at the other end of the room screaming  ARROW  just to see an arrow pierce through the mighty prince. And instead of concentrating as I had to do with all the other bosses, I could actually relax to some extent, it was an awesome coop feeling and I almost felt like crying... After all the struggles... A light shone in the darkness. But the best thing... Has to be the music. Ofcourse, this is a personal preference, but I just think they nailed it better than Aldrich does with his freaking arrow attack, you know when you get in the mood to slay everything you see? That's how I feel right before I get crushed by my own pride.To finalize this review. Dark souls 3 has taught me that you will face struggles, but dedication is key. And if you're stuck, you simply have to git gud.But it has also taught me that you don't have to make your journey alone, that there is strength to rely on others to aid you. That sometimes you have to swallow your pride and accept that somethings, you cannot do on your own.I started this journey with anger and I ended it in pure happiness. It is a fun and challenging game, but be warned, it will test your mentality more than your computer specs."

Dark Souls 1 showed me the joy of a game not holding my hand and pointing me in the direction I need to go. Dark Souls 2 introduced me to invasions and PvP, playing with builds and trying crazy strats to defeat my opponents. Dark Souls 3 came with a more easy and linear approach to the series but not lacking in difficulty due to the new timing and wind up animation of bosses. The scaling of areas and breath taking views that you encounter will leave you in ahhh as you discover shortcuts, traps and mobs that will wreck you within minuets. The variety of bosses will keep your heart racing and wanting more. There are also a massive verity of builds that you can create for pvp and online play. As a fan of every Dark Souls, I must highly recommend this game for veterans and noobs of the series."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 16, 2018              Dark Souls 3 + Ashes of Ariandel DLC: Final Flame My introduction to the Soulsborne series was with Bloodborne as most people who have read my writings or have talked to me in the past, I did play a little bit of Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the first sin but for reasons that I will not go into too much here I left it to focus on other games. This game will mark the first Dark Souls game I have played till completion and I must say I am happy to have finished this game rather than DS 2. What a great send off to such a venerable series. Because the lore and story of Dark Souls is vague and up for interpretation I will only give what I know in regards to the summery. The Dark Souls world of Lordarn is stuck in a cycle of fire and dark, with each game taking place towards the end of a fire age. You are the Chosen Undead/ Cursed Undead/ Unkindled who rise from their graves in order to link the fire and prolong the inevitable coming of the age of darkness. This time the Unkindled (different from the Chosen Undead in ways I am not sure of at time of writing) have risen to seek out the four Lords of Cinder who all abandoned their duties to link the fire and force them to for fill their jobs. Along the way the Unkindled will meet some interesting people and try to understand what the hell happened. The Ashes of Ariandel DLC has the Unkindled travel into the Painted World of Ariandel to try to save Ariandel from some strange rot that is threatening to destroy that world. Most of the story is told either through item descriptions, music, levels or short interactions between characters. Cut scenes are short and rare. I really like this form of storytelling not only because it is a rarity among most video game narratives but that the fact it is done so well.  The small bits of lore and story not only keep the player wanting to press on to find out more but also allows room for imagination to fill in the blanks, something that a lot of games are too afraid to do on the off chance that some demographic might lose out and as a result is a lot more compelling than most video games. The music in of itself can tell us more about a boss then any monologue could hope to do and I love it. (Before I get into the game play, please use a controller if you are going to get any of the Soulsborne games, I will go into this part later but playing with keyboard and mouse will make your experience much, much worse.) Game play is mostly the same of any entry in the Soulsborne series; based around stamina management, item load and rolling. Exploration is key in these games as you will need to grind for souls should the need arise and make such you have any items that may give the tiniest advantage in your journey. The levels encourage exploration due to the maze like quality they have, looping around and in on themselves with short cuts and hidden areas. Yet they appear to be places where people have lived and died, you never get lost in the maze nor do you never not know where you going. The combat leans closer to Bloodborneâs fast paced combat encouraging you to jump in and out to get in a few hits. There is also the online aspect where you can leave little notes to other players, you can also summon in other players or get invaded by said players to engage in PVP, at the time of writing the servers are still up and fairly well occupied, you will be able to find a player willing to help you or invade you throughout the game. The problem with hackers is not as bad now, only encountered two so far (might be down to luck of course...) The game play is sharp and very enjoyable; the Soulsborne series is one of the few games that I enjoy grinding in because of the fun combat and the difficulty keeping it interesting and fun. The graphics might not be the most top notch, high end graphics in the world, it is smooth and looks good on a higher specs PC, the real star lies in the art style and creature designs, a majority of the levels are massive gothic cities and lordly halls that make you feel like a tiny insect scrabbling across a mighty world that is falling apart around you,  a standout is Ithryll of the Boreal Valley because of itâs soft moonlight sky sweeping over a sleeping gothic city, different shades of blues and whites create such an breath taking visual even on the lowest setting. My jaw dropped when I saw it. This game on any setting looks amazing because it has such a defined art style. The creature designs are appropriately grisly and laden with body horror; much like what Bloodborne was going with if not slightly less disturbing.  When I got this game my PC was.....shall we say was not suitable for running the game well, however I was able to upgrade to something closer to the requirements, any problems encountered pre upgrade will not be taken into account. However post upgrade I still encountered crashes when I minimised the game, loading into a level or respawning after dying. Fortunately nothing was lost but it is annoying that I have to start up the game often multiple times because one area decided to crash over and over again each time I died and considering how hard this game is, that is a lot of times. The fact that the PC port is barebones when it comes to controls and the tutorial does not bother to have the controls match the commands make a controller essential if frustrating first experience. One would think that From/ Namco Bandai would have learned from the original Dark Souls port but that sadly has never been the case.  Despite this the game does run smooth with no noticeable frame rate dips or glitches.Overall, Dark Souls 3 is a great send off to the series, a solid end before it outstayed itâs welcome and I look forward to what FromSoftware does next. It will not be in the hall of fame due to the shoddy PC port but it does get very close.https://imaginativerambling.wixsite.com/imaginativeramblings/all-posts/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-dlc-final-flame Check my review here along with other reviews only found on Imaginativeramblings"

You will die by a slash of a sword, by a slice-and-dice axe, by a bonecrushing hammer, or by a piercing spear; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls III. It is education, it is progress, it is the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in your gaming experience since forever â it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Because your chances of success seem so slim when first starting up a new game, each victory feels monumental and self-gratifying. The DLCs' are also great and thrilling to play through, and in my honest opinion also have some of the greatest and most arduous boss fights you will ever encounter in the Dark Souls series, but i'll let you decide on that matter. One of the most memorable experiences that I've ever been blessed by, therefore I shall rate this game 10 out of 10 finger but holes!"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 22, 2017              After hearing a lot about the series, and my friend spamming me every day to buy Dark Souls III, I gave in. I bought it. I expected pain, struggle, and a refund after the first five minutes.. However, that's not what I got. I'll admit, I have a lot of experience in RPG games as I have over 300h in The Witcher 3, but this took quite some time to get used to. You'll constantly get destroyed by mob enemies, and even when you think you're safe, you'll get a giant tree that smacks you down. However, once you get the hang of it, this game is going to be one of the most enjoyable games you've played. There is no minimap, there is no saving and loading (there are checkpoints, though). There's not a single indicator of what you're supposed to do. The game has a lot of sidequests, but you'll have no idea how to actually complete them, so the wiki will probably be your best friend in the game. Multiplayer is a big thing in this game. You can either summon a white phantom, who can help you kill a boss (even though you should fight the bosses all by yourself, or you'll find the game too easy), or a red phantom, who will absolutely destroy you with his +10 Ultra Greatsword that he bought from Tesco. I'm currently going through my NG+ and I don't plan to stop playing any time soon, so I definitely recommend this game to you."

Now, getting into the heart of the matter, as part of the DkS trilogy it's the worst in terms of PvE (besides being the easiest of the series, even DkS II had a few good areas beyond the DLCs) and PvP (not due to connectivity, which is by far the best of the series, but lack of poise and variety of weapons; spammable weapons and stunlock weapon arts being so popular, especially among gankers, as a direct consequence of the aforesaid). It turns to be a pretty straightforward experience with little, if any, differences between playthroughs and boring duels / invasions."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 10, 2018              Dark Souls is a game that you'll either love to hate or grow to love. An experience that can be both exillerating & frustrating all at once, yet you'll find yourself coming back constantly!About The Game:Dark Souls is developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandi (Europe & International), Atlas (US) & FromSoftware (Japan). Dark Souls III is the third & final installment in the Dark Souls franchise. Dark Souls III takes all aspects from the other Dark Souls games and perfects them making this the best experience of the series & a worthy final installment to the franchise.The Dark Souls franchise is well know for its punishing difficulty, but is Dark Souls REALLY that difficult? Well yes, but it's not what people would intially think. Dark Souls developer Hidetaka Miyazaki insists on creating a living & believable world which is more challenging than punishing which makes its difficulty justified.The Story:Dark Souls III story centres around the player (known as Ashen One or Unkindled) waking up after the bell tolls signaling the coming end to the Age of Fire, you are considered the next in line to light the fire and prolong the Age of Fire should the first fail to complete their goal.During your quest you must defeat the 5 Lords of Cinder & rekindle the flame to start the next Age of Fire, this is considered the right thing to do, but it's up to the player to decide if they want to persue this age or if they'd rather persue one of the other endings, thus giving the player multiple choices & other reasons to play through again.From here your story becomes your own.The Gameplay:Dark Souls III takes off putting your right in the deep end and expecting the player to learn on their own time. There's VERY little tutorial & very little explaination of where to go and what to do. The player must make their way from their awakening point to the Firelink Shrine & reignite the flame there in order to even begin embarking on their quest to reignite the flame but first comes death, then comes frustration & eventually comes success.Enemies at the start of the game are very weak and will die within 1 or 2 hits of your chosen combat style, however this won't last for long & players will eventually find themselves overwhelmed by difficult & brutal enemies which will happily gank you in large groups.If you're not willing to put in hours of time learning how to effectively stratergize and learning patterns to beat enemies this game will kick you @ss. Combat feels fluent & for most cases you'll have very little time getting a grasp of it, learning to dodge, block and parry attacks & finally learning good times to strike in order to take little or no damage. As such Dark Souls expects the player to take their time & not rush into combat head first, but rather examine their surroundings, decide on which enemies should be targetted first & then putting everything you've learned from your multiple deaths into practise and finally progressing forward.Combat in Dark Souls consists of 3 different forms Melee, Magic & Archery, each with their own various flaws and strengths in combat situations & each requiring various levelling of attributes in order to be effective with certain weapons & armour types.Bosses in Dark Souls follow different fomulas & can be overbearing to new players but with persistence can be easily & often quickly dispached of. That's not to say that the bosses are pushovers, they will by all intesive purposes kick your @ss several times until you get lucky or are able to get their attack patterns & your dodge times perfected.Dark Souls features its usual multiplayer aspect here as well, Multiplayer consists of 4 different types of interactions:Other-worldly Phantoms: The most common kind of phantom you will see are the Other-worldly Phantoms, these white phantoms will occasionally phaze in and out of existance as you progress through the game. These phantoms are other players in their own worlds in the general vacinity of you. They serve no purpose but to add to the feeling of seclusion in your own world but they can be entertaining to watch flail around on occasion.Friendly Phantoms: Friendly Phantoms will leave a glowing White or Gold sign on the ground with their White Soap Stone which you can use to summon to your world in order to Co-operate in defeating the world boss or by going through the entire stage and completing everything together. (These phantoms will generally summon with a White or Gold aura around them. They can VERY rarely be Purple as well, if you see a Purple they are considered a Mad Phantom & CAN attempt to kill you in PvP.)Dark & Mad Spirits/Phantoms: These Phantoms/Spirits are classed as  Invaders  they will occasionally enter your world at random and attempt to kill you, don't be fooled, these are actually players who've summoned themselves into your world so you need to be careful of what you're doing & what's around you. Dark or Mad Spirits/Phantoms will generally be Red or Purple but they can sometimes be Blue or Gold as well. (This being said not EVERY Mad Phantom or Dark Spirit that invades you wants to kill you. It can be an experience some times.)Player Messages: These glowing Orange messages exist throughout the world, some are placed by the Developers to guide newer players through the world & offer advice. Most however are placed by other players, these messages can offer advice on combat, give tips on ambushes or point players to hidden items or secret locations. Others can point players to their death so trust these messages with caution!The Verdict:Dark Souls is a series that not everybody will love but it can certainly be a series that will grow on you the more you play them. As somebody who used to dislike & not get the hype around the series I finally took the plunge and I can safely say I now understand what my friends were talking about when they kept raving about this game to me all those times.Dark Souls III gives you a challenge but for the most part is fair & when you die it's (MOSTLY) the fault of your own actions, occasionally the game can be cheap & let an enemy stun lock you without giving you a chance to fight back.Dark Souls III is not perfect by any means, it has its flaws & they do occasionally pop up, like delayed actions upon taking damage your action will play out after the damage animation finishes putting you right into another situation you can die from, connection time outs which can halt your progress if a Dark Spirit tries to Invade but fails to connect. But these are few and far between & can easily be overlooked when you get into the other great aspects.Dark Souls III is a beautifully crafted world, fairly detailed for the most part & has graphics that still stand out to this day for its age. There are some TRULY outstanding and beautiful section in this game that are breathtaking, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley & Anor Londo being the most standout of these places.Note: I haven't even touched on half the things in this game that I wish I had the character limit to put here, but with what I have written I'm at my maximum cap. If you want to know more then check out some reviews from people you trust.With all this said can I recommend the game?Recommendation?Yes this is a recommendation from me! Pick this game up whenever you can if you think you'd be interested in it."

Not to say the other games are worse, but this game definitely gets major points for being the most fluid of them all. Combat, weapon fighting styles, bosses and progression is all very streamlined, and the difficulty will gear you up for the previous games. The ONLY major complaint I have for this game that would be important for new players to know, pure-casting builds are not beginner friendly, and don't function well in the early game."

Only if youre a person whos into  games with many mechanics to fidget with.....I got introduced to this game through the Dragon Age games since the weapon upgrades were equally as important and survival depended on top notch management of your gear of you and your party. Be prepared to experiment as when something doesnt work youll have to be adaptable enough to use everything the game gives you at your disposal at that given moment.Most importantly, Dark Souls is not hard as long as you realize that you are suppose to fail to figure out what works and what doesnt. Once you get that through your head, youll have alot of fun actually instead of frustration."

Don't play this game if you give up easily. Do play this game if you love challenging gameplay set in an epic fantasy world, filled with tons of exploration and lore.Try it out, it super cheap during the steam sales."

Now, getting into the heart of the matter, as part of the DkS trilogy it's the worst in terms of PvE (besides being the easiest of the series, even DkS II had a few good areas beyond the DLCs) and PvP (not due to connectivity, which is by far the best of the series, but lack of poise and variety of weapons; spammable weapons and stunlock weapon arts being so popular, especially among gankers, as a direct consequence of the aforesaid). It turns to be a pretty straightforward experience with little, if any, differences between playthroughs and boring duels / invasions."

The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel... bland.Overall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now... which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked."

You can fail hundreds of times, countless hours gone. But with each attempt you get a little closer to success. A little bit closer to understanding why you may be looking at a situation the wrong way, why you can't just go all in at once and expect to win. It also shows you that there are so many others stuck in the same way you are, each feeling lost - each on the border of going hollow.  I could write for days to explain everything I've learned from this game. Know this, you won't regret buying or playing, but you may just find your own flame along the way."

Amazing detail in the level design. Lore is fascinating like the first installment. The weapon arts are really fun and encourage you to try all the weapons. Bosses will have your heart beating like crazy as you get to the end of their health bar. And the DLC ended up being some of the best add-on content money can buy."

        "Comments": "Posted: January 1, 2017               It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard... is what makes it great. Taking its cues from Bloodborne, the speed of play has been dramatically increased in this latest Dark Souls outing and combat is a lot more stressful and punishing than it was in the first two games too. Relative to a series renowned for its challenge, the earlier levels contribute to a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but souls (the currency that allows a player to gain items and improve their character's abilities) are kept in short supply and the hub area where they can be spent is locked away until a player  graduates  from the first boss fight.Whereas the bosses are comparable to previous games in terms of difficulty, they're almost upstaged by the regular enemies who attack with heightened speed and aggression at every opportunity. Long gone are the lumbering knights and club-wielding underlings of Dark Souls II, here you're frequently accosted by bizarre horrors including crystalline beasts, demented stat-reducing jailers, and crazed demons that will literally try to rip your character's head off!Aside from new features like the smart skill system and some welcome changes to how magic behaves, Dark Souls III is very reminiscent of past games in the series. The story concerns the four Lords of Cinder whose departure has plunged the cursed Kingdom of Lothric into chaos. Players take on the mantle of the Ashen One and must return the Lords - or at least their heads - to their  moulding thrones  so that the undead curse can be averted once and for all.Fans of the series will be glad to know that Dark Souls III does not sell out on the qualities that have made it so successful and admired up until now. The gameplay is still tense, the environments still inspire awe, and the fragmented tapestry that makes up the game's narrative will take many hours of decrypting in order to knit together.There are elements that feel a bit tired; it's only natural after so many sequels, but it's commendable how successful FromSoftware has been in trying to keep the series feeling fresh and exciting. The boss battles are an especially good example of this. Improving on the mediocre confrontations that characterized much of Dark Souls II, here the actual number of bosses is reduced in favour of providing more honed and interesting confrontations. Dark Souls III has bosses that set a new high for the series and each one is very different in look and execution. The variety here is bolstered by several good commonalities including interesting arena design, superb backing music, and dynamic move sets.Dark Souls III does well to introduce some circuitous level design towards the end and even though the more linear approach in the first half is focused and effective, it's fair to say that those expecting another vast and interconnected world like the one from Dark Souls are probably going to feel a tinge of disappointment. That's not to say that this is a small game though as you'll find Lothric to be a huge place that's absolutely brimming with enemies to slay and secrets to find. It may not be as vast as Drangleic was in Dark Souls II, but Lothric does feel more packed with content and it's a rare area indeed that doesn't feature a satisfying verticality to it.In terms of this PC version specifically, Dark Souls III is a success beyond words when compared to the ports of previous entries. The 60FPS action is fluid, the graphics are sharp, and the loading screens are so short that item descriptions will disappear before you can even finish reading them! Conversely though, there is a tendency for the game to pause slightly when picking up items and it sometimes has trouble streaming certain areas; blocking them off behind unsightly fog barriers until they finish loading. The environments are still well designed - you can expect to see plenty of  gorgeous views ahead  - although the game as a whole is rather grey in appearance and it can be easy to miss areas and NPCs because of how well they blend into their surroundings.My time with the PC version was smooth sailing on the whole though and I can only hope that future software updates help those players who have reported crashes and related bugs during the launch period.In terms of performance, it's important to state how well this game plays with regards to its multiplayer too. Whilst Dark Souls was more experimental and arguably ill-suited to serious cooperative/competitive play, the series as a whole has always been too good not to share and FromSoftware have taken steps to further improve the network code for this new release. Players can still summon human-controlled phantoms to assist in clearing out levels and bosses and the number of permitted players in each host's world has been boosted for more team-based insanity than ever before.Multiplayer has been a very strong focus for FromSoftware this time around and it really shows. The disastrous soul memory feature from Dark Souls II has been axed in favour of simple matchmaking rules (including a glorious password system for friends) that eliminate a lot of the undue frustration associated with summoning other players. The realms of PvP and PvE feel closely intertwined in Dark Souls III. Estus healing is quicker, combat is more nuanced, and you'll likely find a deluge of summoning signs and invaders in every new area that you visit.Whether they're the hostile red phantoms that want nothing more than to kill you, the gold phantoms that want to earn medals for helping you, or the mysterious purple phantoms (God only knows what they want) entering your world, the potential for player interaction is off the charts.FromSoftware has acted to make sure that players feel more secure in general though and Dark Souls III seems to be more protective of its PvE players as a result. Likely an attempt to curb trolling, red phantoms seem to be regularly, if not exclusively matched up with  victims  who have already summoned helpers into their world. In this way it seems that player invasions have lost some their non-hardcore appeal as a red phantom will frequently find themselves staring down multiple foes instead of just one. There are fewer easy kills to be had in this game that's for sure.There are signs of franchise fatigue, most noticeably in the number of callbacks and references to previous games in the series. At times the setting in Dark Souls III risks losing its sense of identity and becoming that of a mere nod to the first Dark Souls. Whilst a subtle musical cue or visual reference does hit the mark from time to time, there are too many revelations in this game that failed to surprise me because I found it easy to anticipate what was going to be another tribute.It's impossible to feel unsatisfied with Dark Souls III as a complete package though and you can easily expect a 50+ hour initial playthrough if you're committed to searching every nook and cranny the game has to offer. The game has its lesser points, but none of them are severe enough to stop it from being a fitting end to what is perhaps the greatest trilogy of video games there has ever been.Much like the motif of fire and embers; a visual that permeates the game's bosses and locations as much as it does your player character, there's a certain warmth about Dark Souls III. It's a familiar resplendence found in the sweaty grip of the controller after slaying a towering boss, so too is it found in the game's deep backstory, its beautiful environments and the mystery behind its many secrets and hidden endings. The developers may have gotten a little nostalgic for this entry sure, but I'll be damned if they didn't earn the indulgence.Read the full review at my blog Â»[www.celjaded.com]"

I know that after some hours i will master that game,and will finish it without problems. Now just forget all this.To beat this game YOU have to be better every moment.Equips and level are just a detail,its your strategy of exploring your quality and the enemy weekness that will decide the fight.You will lose that line of thinking  Thats impossible  and  I will never be able to do that , and start to say  And if i try that diferent way  or  I will try it 1000 times,but if in the 1001 i suceed,then will be worth it ."

You take the sword out of his body and then the boss battle begins. It ends after 50 deaths, 5 rage quits and more like 30 minutes of watching tutorials of how to defeat it. The main point is, that, don't buy this game if you don't have balls of steel.10/10 Hardest game ever."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 6, 2018              The difficulty level and style of gameplay of the Dark Souls series I feel has now become legendary, often leading to other games being referred to as souls-like; moreover, creating something of a sub-genre of its own.To start off, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants deep character customization, and replayability. Think back to your days in the early final fantasy games, you spend 100+ hours developing your character only to get to the end of the game with nothing left to do, and only one area that maybe presents a moderate challange. With features like new game +, and an entire world of people to co-op or battle with, you have a game that will always offer you something to do with that character you spent all that time creating. To add to its challenging and enjoyable combat style, you have the ability to mix and match an entire armoury of weapons, shields, and magic that allows for the creation of nearly any kind of character theme that a person could conjure up.While all three games offer you a lot of options for character creation, each I feel provides greater focus on certain gameplay styles. The first being an unrefined game that for me offered the most interesting world, and the second which offered the smoothest gameplay and various combat enhancements, while the third enhances combat in a number of ways that if I'm not mistaken are unique to only this installment of the series.-Weapon Arts were options for most weapons that enhanced the ability of ranged weaponry, two-handed, and weapon & shield style combat. They provided additional abilities that are unique to certain weapon types: such as a quick-shot or triple-shot with a bow, to the famous samurai iaido slash, or special parry animations, to charging attacks and fencing combos.-Paired Weapons are the replacement for the power-stancing option of Dark Souls II; however, it limits you to only those individual weapons, unlike the power-stance option which could combine your own selection of weaponry. Although one advantage of this is that the paired weapons recieve buffs on both of their pieces as they are considered a single weapon.-A belt bar was added to your (pause-type menu) which gave you five more items that were easy to get to quick.-The ability to quickly revert back to the first item on your ten slots of items made it nice for finding your extus flask instead of going through the entire list of items you had equipped.-Password Connection Option allowed you to connect with anyone, regardless of level.So all in all they did add some neat features to this game; however, the smoothness of Dark Souls II was lost on this installment, combat feels more clunky and less flowing. The loss of power-stancing makes duel-wielding only a good option if a paired weapon is used. So as I mentioned above about each game providing more benifits to different styles, I feel that this game provided a much better gameplay experience for the following styles:-Ranged Weaponry-Two-Handed-Weapon & Shield-Specialist Spellcaster"

It probably first started with you picking up the original Dark souls (or Demons souls. I myself never played the game, did not own a ps3 and still don't own a console), you played it, you hated it but you loved it even more, than came in the DLC, you thought it could never get better but you thought wrong, it was a masterpiece.     Then came Darks souls 2, you probably didn't like it too much, the gameplay was good and the environment breath taking but it couldn't do what the first game did. If you were like me then you probably waited for the  Scholar of the first sin  version to come out, the game by then was a bit more polished and loads more fun, still nowhere near it's precursor.     And then came this game, your expectations were probably a bit low after the second game but once you started palying it you become enthralled, and if you were anythng like me you forget about everything that was going around you for the time being, I rarely got off my pc till the time I completed my first playthrough, I currently do not own the DLC so there is not much I can say about it but I hope to get it soon and complete what could be the very last chapter of the series, this series will always have a special place in my heart. Thank you Dark Souls."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 5, 2016              Dark Souls III is without a doubt the best entry in the trilogy of games. Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.* PlotDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic  praise the sun!!!!  stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.* DesignDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.*EDIT*After discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.* GameplayThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each  normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.* PresentationMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other teâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥al problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.*OverallDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.8.1/10> Pros-Excellent design-beautiful world-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay> Cons-patronizing design in many places-technical issues-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you"

The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel... bland.Overall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now... which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked."

You can fail hundreds of times, countless hours gone. But with each attempt you get a little closer to success. A little bit closer to understanding why you may be looking at a situation the wrong way, why you can't just go all in at once and expect to win. It also shows you that there are so many others stuck in the same way you are, each feeling lost - each on the border of going hollow.  I could write for days to explain everything I've learned from this game. Know this, you won't regret buying or playing, but you may just find your own flame along the way."

Now, getting into the heart of the matter, as part of the DkS trilogy it's the worst in terms of PvE (besides being the easiest of the series, even DkS II had a few good areas beyond the DLCs) and PvP (not due to connectivity, which is by far the best of the series, but lack of poise and variety of weapons; spammable weapons and stunlock weapon arts being so popular, especially among gankers, as a direct consequence of the aforesaid). It turns to be a pretty straightforward experience with little, if any, differences between playthroughs and boring duels / invasions."

I expected pain, struggle, and a refund after the first five minutes.. However, that's not what I got. I'll admit, I have a lot of experience in RPG games as I have over 300h in The Witcher 3, but this took quite some time to get used to. You'll constantly get destroyed by mob enemies, and even when you think you're safe, you'll get a giant tree that smacks you down. However, once you get the hang of it, this game is going to be one of the most enjoyable games you've played. There is no minimap, there is no saving and loading (there are checkpoints, though). There's not a single indicator of what you're supposed to do. The game has a lot of sidequests, but you'll have no idea how to actually complete them, so the wiki will probably be your best friend in the game. Multiplayer is a big thing in this game. You can either summon a white phantom, who can help you kill a boss (even though you should fight the bosses all by yourself, or you'll find the game too easy), or a red phantom, who will absolutely destroy you with his +10 Ultra Greatsword that he bought from Tesco. I'm currently going through my NG+ and I don't plan to stop playing any time soon, so I definitely recommend this game to you."

        "Comments": "Posted: March 6, 2018              The difficulty level and style of gameplay of the Dark Souls series I feel has now become legendary, often leading to other games being referred to as souls-like; moreover, creating something of a sub-genre of its own.To start off, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants deep character customization, and replayability. Think back to your days in the early final fantasy games, you spend 100+ hours developing your character only to get to the end of the game with nothing left to do, and only one area that maybe presents a moderate challange. With features like new game +, and an entire world of people to co-op or battle with, you have a game that will always offer you something to do with that character you spent all that time creating. To add to its challenging and enjoyable combat style, you have the ability to mix and match an entire armoury of weapons, shields, and magic that allows for the creation of nearly any kind of character theme that a person could conjure up.While all three games offer you a lot of options for character creation, each I feel provides greater focus on certain gameplay styles. The first being an unrefined game that for me offered the most interesting world, and the second which offered the smoothest gameplay and various combat enhancements, while the third enhances combat in a number of ways that if I'm not mistaken are unique to only this installment of the series.-Weapon Arts were options for most weapons that enhanced the ability of ranged weaponry, two-handed, and weapon & shield style combat. They provided additional abilities that are unique to certain weapon types: such as a quick-shot or triple-shot with a bow, to the famous samurai iaido slash, or special parry animations, to charging attacks and fencing combos.-Paired Weapons are the replacement for the power-stancing option of Dark Souls II; however, it limits you to only those individual weapons, unlike the power-stance option which could combine your own selection of weaponry. Although one advantage of this is that the paired weapons recieve buffs on both of their pieces as they are considered a single weapon.-A belt bar was added to your (pause-type menu) which gave you five more items that were easy to get to quick.-The ability to quickly revert back to the first item on your ten slots of items made it nice for finding your extus flask instead of going through the entire list of items you had equipped.-Password Connection Option allowed you to connect with anyone, regardless of level.So all in all they did add some neat features to this game; however, the smoothness of Dark Souls II was lost on this installment, combat feels more clunky and less flowing. The loss of power-stancing makes duel-wielding only a good option if a paired weapon is used. So as I mentioned above about each game providing more benifits to different styles, I feel that this game provided a much better gameplay experience for the following styles:-Ranged Weaponry-Two-Handed-Weapon & Shield-Specialist Spellcaster"

        "Comments": "Posted: January 1, 2017               It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard... is what makes it great. Taking its cues from Bloodborne, the speed of play has been dramatically increased in this latest Dark Souls outing and combat is a lot more stressful and punishing than it was in the first two games too. Relative to a series renowned for its challenge, the earlier levels contribute to a fairly reasonable difficulty curve, but souls (the currency that allows a player to gain items and improve their character's abilities) are kept in short supply and the hub area where they can be spent is locked away until a player  graduates  from the first boss fight.Whereas the bosses are comparable to previous games in terms of difficulty, they're almost upstaged by the regular enemies who attack with heightened speed and aggression at every opportunity. Long gone are the lumbering knights and club-wielding underlings of Dark Souls II, here you're frequently accosted by bizarre horrors including crystalline beasts, demented stat-reducing jailers, and crazed demons that will literally try to rip your character's head off!Aside from new features like the smart skill system and some welcome changes to how magic behaves, Dark Souls III is very reminiscent of past games in the series. The story concerns the four Lords of Cinder whose departure has plunged the cursed Kingdom of Lothric into chaos. Players take on the mantle of the Ashen One and must return the Lords - or at least their heads - to their  moulding thrones  so that the undead curse can be averted once and for all.Fans of the series will be glad to know that Dark Souls III does not sell out on the qualities that have made it so successful and admired up until now. The gameplay is still tense, the environments still inspire awe, and the fragmented tapestry that makes up the game's narrative will take many hours of decrypting in order to knit together.There are elements that feel a bit tired; it's only natural after so many sequels, but it's commendable how successful FromSoftware has been in trying to keep the series feeling fresh and exciting. The boss battles are an especially good example of this. Improving on the mediocre confrontations that characterized much of Dark Souls II, here the actual number of bosses is reduced in favour of providing more honed and interesting confrontations. Dark Souls III has bosses that set a new high for the series and each one is very different in look and execution. The variety here is bolstered by several good commonalities including interesting arena design, superb backing music, and dynamic move sets.Dark Souls III does well to introduce some circuitous level design towards the end and even though the more linear approach in the first half is focused and effective, it's fair to say that those expecting another vast and interconnected world like the one from Dark Souls are probably going to feel a tinge of disappointment. That's not to say that this is a small game though as you'll find Lothric to be a huge place that's absolutely brimming with enemies to slay and secrets to find. It may not be as vast as Drangleic was in Dark Souls II, but Lothric does feel more packed with content and it's a rare area indeed that doesn't feature a satisfying verticality to it.In terms of this PC version specifically, Dark Souls III is a success beyond words when compared to the ports of previous entries. The 60FPS action is fluid, the graphics are sharp, and the loading screens are so short that item descriptions will disappear before you can even finish reading them! Conversely though, there is a tendency for the game to pause slightly when picking up items and it sometimes has trouble streaming certain areas; blocking them off behind unsightly fog barriers until they finish loading. The environments are still well designed - you can expect to see plenty of  gorgeous views ahead  - although the game as a whole is rather grey in appearance and it can be easy to miss areas and NPCs because of how well they blend into their surroundings.My time with the PC version was smooth sailing on the whole though and I can only hope that future software updates help those players who have reported crashes and related bugs during the launch period.In terms of performance, it's important to state how well this game plays with regards to its multiplayer too. Whilst Dark Souls was more experimental and arguably ill-suited to serious cooperative/competitive play, the series as a whole has always been too good not to share and FromSoftware have taken steps to further improve the network code for this new release. Players can still summon human-controlled phantoms to assist in clearing out levels and bosses and the number of permitted players in each host's world has been boosted for more team-based insanity than ever before.Multiplayer has been a very strong focus for FromSoftware this time around and it really shows. The disastrous soul memory feature from Dark Souls II has been axed in favour of simple matchmaking rules (including a glorious password system for friends) that eliminate a lot of the undue frustration associated with summoning other players. The realms of PvP and PvE feel closely intertwined in Dark Souls III. Estus healing is quicker, combat is more nuanced, and you'll likely find a deluge of summoning signs and invaders in every new area that you visit.Whether they're the hostile red phantoms that want nothing more than to kill you, the gold phantoms that want to earn medals for helping you, or the mysterious purple phantoms (God only knows what they want) entering your world, the potential for player interaction is off the charts.FromSoftware has acted to make sure that players feel more secure in general though and Dark Souls III seems to be more protective of its PvE players as a result. Likely an attempt to curb trolling, red phantoms seem to be regularly, if not exclusively matched up with  victims  who have already summoned helpers into their world. In this way it seems that player invasions have lost some their non-hardcore appeal as a red phantom will frequently find themselves staring down multiple foes instead of just one. There are fewer easy kills to be had in this game that's for sure.There are signs of franchise fatigue, most noticeably in the number of callbacks and references to previous games in the series. At times the setting in Dark Souls III risks losing its sense of identity and becoming that of a mere nod to the first Dark Souls. Whilst a subtle musical cue or visual reference does hit the mark from time to time, there are too many revelations in this game that failed to surprise me because I found it easy to anticipate what was going to be another tribute.It's impossible to feel unsatisfied with Dark Souls III as a complete package though and you can easily expect a 50+ hour initial playthrough if you're committed to searching every nook and cranny the game has to offer. The game has its lesser points, but none of them are severe enough to stop it from being a fitting end to what is perhaps the greatest trilogy of video games there has ever been.Much like the motif of fire and embers; a visual that permeates the game's bosses and locations as much as it does your player character, there's a certain warmth about Dark Souls III. It's a familiar resplendence found in the sweaty grip of the controller after slaying a towering boss, so too is it found in the game's deep backstory, its beautiful environments and the mystery behind its many secrets and hidden endings. The developers may have gotten a little nostalgic for this entry sure, but I'll be damned if they didn't earn the indulgence.Read the full review at my blog Â»[www.celjaded.com]"

I mean,i played a lot of games,and i know that in the majority of them,after 10 minutes of gridding i'm able to defeat that boss and continue the game. I know that after some hours i will master that game,and will finish it without problems. Now just forget all this.To beat this game YOU have to be better every moment.Equips and level are just a detail,its your strategy of exploring your quality and the enemy weekness that will decide the fight.You will lose that line of thinking  Thats impossible  and  I will never be able to do that , and start to say  And if i try that diferent way  or  I will try it 1000 times,but if in the 1001 i suceed,then will be worth it ."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 29, 2016              I've played through Dark Salad's first two installments, though I'm not a massive fan of the series. That being said, here's my spiel on the third installment:From is one of those publishers who apparently really like to reuse their formula for gameplay. This is by no means a bad thing, especially since it works here. Overall, the movement for the player and for the varying sizes of flesh in this installment feels way less stiff from previous games. Movements feel faster and more fluid, allowing for combat to be way more intimate over previous installments where the stratagem was usally just to wait for Bigbritches McBossalot to do a heavy attack so you have time to peck at his ankles. The one place this falters, and feel free to tell me I'm wrong about this, is with shields that have 100% physical block. In my opinion, these things make Dark Sutra games way too easy, as only a handful of enemies have alternate means of damage.The enviornment of this game is something to behold. Many of the areas (save for some out of bounds nonsense, as per usual) are marvelously crafted and mind-bendingly interwoven. It's truly something to visit the other half of a destroyed bridge hours of meandering around later. Something I kind of hated about Dark Souls One was the amount of depressing caves and dark areas that were visually akin to hard pudding. There's a lot less of that here, and environments of that sort are better crafted this time around. All I can really say about PvP from my lack of expecience in prior games and lack of a pretentious state of mind is that it's a lot easier to have fun with it if you're new to the series. Being bad is totally fine, because odds are you'll have like 3+ dudes with you engaged in jolly cooperation anyway. Class rebalancing is pretty solid. Weapon stances are a welcome change to make melee combat seem less mundane. The same can be said for spells. Good God there are a lot of magic and faith options this time around--both in gear and in heathen spellcasting. There's so many that I'd even say that the devs clearly favored all classes having at least a bit of every category, because as Strength BigCubberhousen I feel that I'm missing out on quite a lot.Lastly, and this can be a good thing or a bad thing, Dark Souls Tres really, REALLY wants you to remember the first two games. There are so damn many references through bosses, enemies, equipment, areas, and everything else that are about the first two games, mostly Dark Souls One. I honestly feel that they overdid it a bit, because the game feels less like its own thing and more like a reimagining of the first installment. To this end, you might actually enjoy the game more if you haven't played previous installments.Overall, I'd say this game is worth your time if adventure games are your thing, casual or not. Given the game's resources for the player, these games really aren't as hard as they're infamously said to be. In fact, I'd say they do difficulty extraordinarily well, as encounters are engaging and require you to think quite a lot more than most other modern games, at least that I have played. Murdering those big bosses for the first time really feels like an achievement, and to me that makes the game well worth what I paid for it.In summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZvbN4MXQDM"

I expected pain, struggle, and a refund after the first five minutes.. However, that's not what I got. I'll admit, I have a lot of experience in RPG games as I have over 300h in The Witcher 3, but this took quite some time to get used to. You'll constantly get destroyed by mob enemies, and even when you think you're safe, you'll get a giant tree that smacks you down. However, once you get the hang of it, this game is going to be one of the most enjoyable games you've played. There is no minimap, there is no saving and loading (there are checkpoints, though). There's not a single indicator of what you're supposed to do. The game has a lot of sidequests, but you'll have no idea how to actually complete them, so the wiki will probably be your best friend in the game. Multiplayer is a big thing in this game. You can either summon a white phantom, who can help you kill a boss (even though you should fight the bosses all by yourself, or you'll find the game too easy), or a red phantom, who will absolutely destroy you with his +10 Ultra Greatsword that he bought from Tesco. I'm currently going through my NG+ and I don't plan to stop playing any time soon, so I definitely recommend this game to you."

I actually thought I would hate this game to its guts, but the hype from the fanbase was just too much. I decided to preorder and give it a shot. When I began playing the game on the first day, I struggled to use keyboard and mouse(A shame there is no kb/m overlay). As a result, I died many times and I kept struggling to actually attempt to enjoy the game. However, after many defeats and many dissatisfactions, I finally beat my first boss WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE! Now, I don't usually get hyped after completing a tutorial level, but this game was totally different. It didn't just give me some mindless skeletons to fight, but it also gave me a boss to fight, which by the way, gave me a headache.Each level was more enormous than the one before it with enemies that were sometimes huge. When I finally beat the game, I couldn't believe it was finally over. I was actually sad that there no more remaining bosses that could give me suffering and frustration. In my opinion, this game turned me into a masochist. Though, what the hell is up with all this weird English poetic stuff? Did the writers just read Shakespeare and decide to write in whatever word they thought had a good ring to it?10/10"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 5, 2016              Dark Souls III is without a doubt the best entry in the trilogy of games. Dark Soul I and II are both bereft of problems and issues with quality that DSIII deftly escapes, leaving an incredible experience that rivals Bloodborne, one of the best games of the eighth generation of consoles. It's also a solid finale, with a good sense of closure that will stick with you.* PlotDark Souls III is much like it's predecessors in that it's vague. Little is explained to the player, forcing them to make logic connections between plot threads to reach answers. The enviroment itself tells a story, requring the player to make judgements based on what they see, hear and read. Item descriptions hide chunks of lore that explain everything from character identities and outfits to who they are and what they want. The plot itself is sparse, though some lategame revelations had me reeling. Overall, it's a good ending to the franchise, and i'm eagerly awaiting the DLC to wrap up some of the games' missing story threads. Dark Souls III's biggest problem in the story department, then, is that it refuses to stop jerking DSI off. The amount of references to Demons Souls, DSI and DSII feel incredibly awkward a lot of the time. Some are good, like characters being direct references to people in the first two games yet taking on new roles and personalities, and others are just pathetic  praise the sun!!!!  stuff. It takes you out of the experience when theres such a frequency of them, and it also feels like the creators aren't carefully referencing their other material as they are copying it. The tasteful Demons Souls references are a nice touch however, and show that FROM has not ignored their first game in this style.* DesignDark Souls III has some of the best designed levels in the series. It's challenging without ever feeling unfair, and I died a number of times due to my own incopotence. Levels loop back around on themselves, revealing shortcuts, hidden areas and more with rather incredible abandon. The game will hide stuff from you very easily, and will often reward your troubles with loot or something else. The secret areas of the game are VERY secretive, requiring a hell of a lot of patience and careful exploration to uncover them all. The enemies are also a challenge as well, and some of the tougher ones can require multiple tries until they're vanquished. Despite this good, Dark Souls III really feels like it holds your hand some times. The frequency in which there are bonfires feels incredibly patronizing at times, and the game never feels like it's really challenging you with the scarcity of them. It's rare that unlocking a shortcut feels good, but when it does it feels great. The game is also obviously unfinished once more. While not to the rather extreme extent of DSII, it is painfully obvious that this game couldn't fit everything it wanted in, and that the developers were running out of time. One example of this is the games runtime (20 hours), which is incredibly short compared to DSI and II, though this isn't a problem as the game never stops being good- even the hardest, most frustrating areas are much better paced and way more fun than the worst areas of DSI and II., meaning the game never drags through terrible areas like Blightown or the Undead Crypt. Another irritating thing is that many of the improvements from DSII, from online to gameplay, are completely removed, setting the legitimate evolution of PvP in DSII back a few steps. Magic has also been nerfed quite a bit, and I feel like it's become too costly to use. Melee seems to be the way to go, and it's sad to see that only a few playstyles can really work given DSI's incredible flexibility in this regard.*EDIT*After discussion with friends it's become apparent that this balance issue has gotten out of hand. Magic is still useless in comparison to swords, Pyromancy still needs heavy tuning, and slower weapons like greatswords are useless due to their average scaling, meaning they won't do as much DPS as a straight sword. However, none of this is as bad as the poise problem, which is such a glaring and horrible oversight. I won't discuss it here, but suffice to say that poise functions much different in this game than in the second and first, and it's a terrible substitute for the function in the first game. From needs to get theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥together and fix these issues because it's starting to become a serious, game hampering issue. Also PvP is hot â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage, is super unbalanced, etc.* GameplayThe gameplay of DSIII is very much refined from the first two games. DSIII is faster, tougher and better than the first two games. Enemies are stronger and hit faster, requiring careful dodging and percise strikes. This makes for an incredibly tense experience in every single encounter, and makes the game incredibly fun against even the average mook. Bosses are better than ever, with some of the most creative and interesting fights in the series. Covenants are back and a lot of them are quite fun, with some classics from the first game returning gloriously, and the game allows you to switch them on the fly, going from glorious Sunbro to backstabbing Rosiarias Fingers in the matter of moments. This game also reintroduces the magic meter from Demons's Souls, but with an added twist- weapons can now perform special attacks which drain this bar. These moves can be anything from a guard-breaking upward swing to sending out a stream of fire, and they make each  normal, special, and boss-made weapon feel incredibly unique and add to the playstyle of that weapon. Now a sword and board user can be much more dangerous as he can easily break your guard, and spear users can become even deadlier with their horrificly long gap closing attacks, to say nothing of the incredibly cool and badass special attacks of the boss soul weapons. The gameplay is overall a massive improvement on DSII.* PresentationMusic is as usual fantastic and LOUD, though not to the height of Bloodborne- some tracks do come close, however, such as the amazing final boss theme ( DON'T LISTEN TO IT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN THE GAME BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS) The game also looks stellar, boasting the graphical improvements of Bloodbornes new engine to create some excellent locales. Many of the games locations look absolutely stunning, and contain some really excellent enviromental design. The game has a lot of technical issues, however, and whenever I entered a new area the game would horrifically stutter. I've also heard that the game has a lot of other teâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥al problems, so stay wary if you don't have a good PC. The game ran pretty well, and never dropped below 30 FPS for my game running on High, so just be careful.*OverallDSIII is an excellent conclusion to a great series, and I eagerly await the DLC in order to see what else FROM can squeeze in to what could be one of their strongest releases. Until they fix the problems with magic and builds, however, this will remain a flawed but fun game.8.1/10> Pros-Excellent design-beautiful world-fun, deep and satisfiying gameplay> Cons-patronizing design in many places-technical issues-many playstyles are bad, only a few can really carry you"

Only if youre a person whos into  games with many mechanics to fidget with.....I got introduced to this game through the Dragon Age games since the weapon upgrades were equally as important and survival depended on top notch management of your gear of you and your party. Be prepared to experiment as when something doesnt work youll have to be adaptable enough to use everything the game gives you at your disposal at that given moment.Most importantly, Dark Souls is not hard as long as you realize that you are suppose to fail to figure out what works and what doesnt. Once you get that through your head, youll have alot of fun actually instead of frustration."

I bet it's safe to buy now, yet always keep in mind, that you do NOT want to take gifts from people you haven't met, and don't trust.Please note this review will be positive once the anti-cheat is fixedI'm not the type which puts a lot of effort into his reviews, but I'll say what's on my mind.So overall this is the greatest milestone in the Souls series. However, it's also the most troubled version of all the Souls games.Yes.. We're talking about hackers. Now, it's nothing new with hackers on the PC platform, however what's been going on with DS3 lately is ridicolous. I'd like to refer to my thread at the steam discussions for more information about this.The atmosphere and general sound, is amazing. Especially the atmosphere. Have you heard the Firelink music? It's awesome, go look it up on Youtube. Now, now. I'm not much in this game for the sounds ofcourse, as it's the gameplays (and partly the graphics?) that really matters to me.The gameplay is solid, and is challenging like you'd expect from a Souls game. I personally don't feel like it's the hardest there's been, but that may be because it's not my first Souls experience anymore. What I find most astounding, is the online play (except for the mentioned hackers and modders), which consists of you, and other people being able to both invade, summon and being summoned into other worlds as phantoms. My 64 hours in this game, is mostly consisting of PvP. The variety and fun you can have, finishing a PvP build, and then wrecking havoc in other host's worlds is really great.Now, is the PvP balanced? No, and you probably wouldn't be able to name one game which has perfect balancing. however, From is doing a good job at trying to patch, when someone finds, and exploits an insanely good combo/weapon.That's it. Not a great review, but I don't really have more time to write this now.One last thing: Please for the love of god, don't pick up items from a person whom you find highly suspicious, or have seen hack. This may get you banned. To combat this ridicolous anti-cheat, do regular back-ups."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 8, 2016              After 154 hours and all achievements cleared, I think I have a pretty good idea of Dark Souls 3's worth.As a video game it's an 8/10, as a Soul game it's a 4/10. Even Dark Souls 2 was better and I didn't even liked it in the first place !I'll go into details of what's wrong with this game if you're willing to go through my following wall of text.Oh, and I'm not gonna talk about the various crashes and wrong softbans that have plagued people since I've experienced none of both.SoulBorneHere's the biggest problem right away. It isn't Dark Souls, it's Bloodborne with a side of DKS. Don't get me wrong, I kinda liked Bloodborne but it's just a gimped DKS with more button mashing, little challenge and faster gameplay. Build variety, one of the strongest point of the Soul series, is nowhere to be seen in BB.So, when From Software decided to do DKS3, they probably looked upon their latest game that everybody was praising for inspirations. The DKS (including Demon Souls)  series has always been about careful decision and slower combat that allow you ample time to understand what you're dealing with and how you should react, from here it was in your hands to deal with what come your way. Too careful was a terrible idea and recklessness was a sure way to a quick death.In DKS3, none of this matter. Hell, even getting  gud  is optional :- Instant Estus chuging plus you get a lot of them very soon in the game.- RB to death anything and anyone. - Dodge all day long.- Fast roll for everyone.- More invincibility frame than ever before.- +40% HP while being Enkindled.- Poise is gone but enemies don't have it too ! Mash that RB button !- Hyperamor is a terrible mechanism and can be abused with laughable ease.With all that on your side, believe you me, it's rather hard to die. So forget about the idea of challenge right away.And if it's really too hard for you, you can summon up to FOUR phantoms to handhold you, no need for easy mode or actually play the game ! People will willingly help you get rid of that pesky boss and of those nasty invaders. 4 VS 1 (or even 5 VS 1 if you use 911-DARKMOON) is a sure way to be completly rid of the only feature that's moderatly exciting.PVP : Pain VS PleasureYou will quickly realise that From Software got tired of hearing complains about the nasty red phantoms that invade poor innocent carebears to murder them for Souls and giggles. Mostly giggles though.Anyway, tired of hearing all this Miyazaki probably said :  let's give everybody the finger and turn PVP into an horrible snoozefest ! I don't know about you, but I've loved PVP in previous instalment, both as the invader and the invaded. It added a unique thrill to the game, even more so when you've passed the 500h mark and can play it in your sleep.So what's in it for you if you like PVP ? Let's split that from the invader and host side.As an invader :- You get ganked. A lot. If you enjoyed DKS2  Gank Squad  that might be your thing though.- Prepare to be spammed to death.- New meta PVP : bait the host and his (jolly) cohort to their death like never before.- Jolly coop-invasion (when available)- The grieving opportunities are both numerous and hilarious. (Giant crab will be your new best friend if you invade for Farron, for example)- Tedious stand of if neither side grab the bait.- [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned] [Phantom summoned]- Get rekt by SL100 and +10 weapon phantom summoned through password matchmaking while SL 15.- Seek for 20+ minutes the host who's playing hide and seek before alt-F4 when found.- Variation : host alt-F4 when defeated or running out of summons.As a host :- Never fear for your life if you summon non stop.- You can take a nap.- Twinking is basically out the window, so no need to fear any unpleasant surprise.- +40% HP.- Double the maximum Estus of the invader.- Free estus everytime your pets phantoms kill an invader.- 911-DARKMOON if all else fail.- If you're alone, you're probably in for an honourable duel if the invader isn't aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥For both :- Equip straigth sword/Katana/rapier and mash RB for easy victory (works in PVE too !)- Dark Sword all day, everyday if you're really terrible at this.- LAG- HORRIBLE LAG- Protip : the more you lag, the easiest you win.- [fail to join session]- [unable to summon]- Protip 2 : A little amount of lag actually double your I-frame while rolling.All in all, PVP is either very enjoyable (little lag, decent opponent that actually knows what he's doing, etc) or an horrible pain (god awful lag, 4 VS 1 equiped with the above mentionned Dark Sword, final destination).PVESPAM RB.Unto next topic.Seriously though, apart from a certain secret boss that is quite challenging (especially for the camera in the first phase), PVE is pretty much a joke. Little challenge, gimmick bosses (by the way, some bosses can be stun locked to death), forgettable enemies, etc.Nothing to see here. Even more so if you've cleared Bloodborne.N.B. : One memorable thing :  OCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIIIIIILOTTE !  that was hilarious and felt utterly dumbGeneral DesignBloodborne went through here for sure. Lothric high wall sure feels like Yharnam and the dark sun of the last part of the game, along with the final boss arena, remembered me of the fight against Gherman.Now put DKS and DKS2 into a blender with Bloodborne and, tada, you got DKS3. Simple as that. Nothing really new and even if the level design is way better than DKS2, it's still terribly dull and dÃ©jÃ  vu.My biggest beef though, in term of design, is against DKS3's music.DKS had a decent but forgettable OST.DKS2 had a boring one.Bloodborne had one of the best OST I've ever heard in a video game.DKS3's OST is just meh. Outside of the title theme and the one of Dancer, it's just displeasing and/or boring.BB had a really great music, it's not hard to see that probably most of BB's budget went into it. Plus, it brought back the fine art of telling a story all of it's own rather than just being a theme to a specific event (I'm thinking about the theme of Ebrietas and Ludwig among others).So when DKS3 hit the shelf I was prepared for a lot of downside but certainly not one on the musical level.When the title theme start playing for the first time I tought  heh, that's nice. Good to hear that From learned for the best side of BB  but then I heard the theme of Vordt of the boreal valley...And I had to turn down my speakers during P2. This bombastic choir and uninspired instrumental is horrible.Oh, I understand very well that it's made for the  epic effect  like some sort of wannabe Two Steps from Hell, but the fight is not epic (it's dull) and the boss is just dumb. Bombastic vocals while litterally spamming RB on the boss'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥is a lot of thing, but certainly not epic.Bloodborne did (let's call it  empty epic , it fits a theme but it's here to give a rythm or to support an atmosphere to a fight more than anything else) it much much better. See  Living Failures ,  Cleric Beast  and  The Hunter .I know I'm terribly partial on the subject of music, but BB certainly set a higher standard than all previous From games Only exception might be Metal Wolf Chaos, make the office of the president of the United States great again and I sure wanted something of that caliber into DKS3 but, tough luck, all I got is this crappy OST ! Thanks From !Conclusion/Casual SoulsLike I said before, DKS3 isn't a bad game. It's a decent game if you've only ever played BB or none of the previous Souls. It sure calls out to a broader audience than just the  OMG so hard  and  Git gud  audience of previous installments..."

The PvE and lore is done really well but on the other hand the PvP balancing and covenants are really poorly done. I feel like FromSoft really took a lot from Bloodborne and put it into this series which wasn't the best idea, the increased speed of PvP causes a lot of it to feel... bland.Overall if they can fix the balancing in the coming months and with the inevitably fantastic DLC that is going to come out I'll give this game a solid 9 right now... which is actually really low considering how much I like it but the balance issues can't be overlooked."

        "Comments": "Posted: January 7, 2018              Buy this game now. I played dark souls 1 and 2 on the 360, and when i moved to pc i figured i'd let it go. I'm so happy i didn't. This is by far the best installment of the souls series. With so many throwbacks and nods to the older games and lore, it's a great time for veteran players, and the gameplay will keep new players hooked while they learn about the lore. With all the nods to the lore and the greatly made Wiki, new players will get hooked on the lore in no timeThe bosses are great, none feel too similar (except vordt using Sif's move set, but i love sif so i'll let it slide). The sound track is amazing. My personal favorite, the abyss watchers, sends chills down my spine. The female vocals seem to tell about the tragedy, and the males voiceing the bravery in the fight. Keeping on the topic of bosses, learning the lore about them will make the fights just so much better. For example, with the Abyss watchers, they were corrupted by the very thing they sought to control/destroy, and they knew so. But with what humanity they had left, they were going to fight. Dark souls 3 follows a reoccuring theme in the souls series. Most of the things you kill, aren't really  bad , but you're instead just putting them out of their missery. Off of bosses, the gameplay is great. Controls are tight and camera seems to always be where it's needed. I find myself worrying less about the camera then i did in ds1 or ds2. The enemies are really diverse, but can get a tad annoying if you run through the game a few times (currently on my 6th play through on my main character, and i â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HATE THRALLS)The art style is absolutelly stunning. It, of course, goes for the very grim and gothic style as all the other souls games do. Softworks just does it so well. It's not all just blacks and greys, it has great colors, and the lighting and fxs are great.The map designs are outstanding. None of them feel annoying, or make you go  ugh, i have to go there again? . The layouts are simple enough to memorize, but complex enough to feel like a nice challenge. The co-op is pretty standard. You summon someone from their soap stones, and they help with a boss or area of the map, then leavePvp is pretty meh, tbh. I'm not a pro player, and i know people like Fighter PL can make pvp super fun, but for me, it's pretty lack luster. With the way staggering works, someone with a fast weapon that staggers and doesn't use too much stamina, they can just just stagger lock. When that doesn't happen, pvp is quite fun, and feel satisfying to kill that red phantom that invaded while you were running from a hoard of hollowed.Overall, i'm no game reviewer, and this is the only review i've written longer than one sentence. But, if you're debating on getting this game, whether you've played previous souls games, or just getting into the series, get it. It's a great game to start the series on, and a great one for veterans. 8/10 for bosses10/10 for soundtrack10/10 for sticking with the lore, and adding onto it8/10 for map design. They're nice, but a select few can get annoying after running them a few times (looking at you, grand archives)9/10 controls7/10 grunt enemies 10/10 co-op, very basic but works well6/10 pvp, very fun when stagger lock isnt involvedoverall, 9/10again, im no pro reviewer"

        "Comments": "Posted: May 4, 2016              A wonderfully crafted, atmospheric world with some of the best character, mob and area design I've ever seen. Equally impressive is the audio, from the chilling sound effects to the fantastic OST, every boss fight feels just that little bit more special because of the incredible music.The gameplay is also brilliant, as good as it has ever been. It's fluid and responsive and totally satisfying. Many of the boss fights require precise timing on rolls and attacks and the game doesn't let you down at all in this regard. The only gameplay issue I can really think of is the camera, on certain fights you will lose your lock on which can mean death at times, it's a shame that this is still an issue after so many games.An area where the game has reviewed poorly is technically but for me it's running nearly perfectly after the recent Nvidia drivers and post game patches, there are only two small portions of the game that deliver less than 60fps on max settings, and only by at most 5fps so it's fair to say I'm hitting 60fps 99% of the time, and you can't ask for much more than that. The game does still suffer with occasional stutter when saving or perhaps when loading assets, it's not all that often but it is noticeable when it happens and I hope it's fixed, it wasn't a problem in Dark Souls II which I recently completed.Now it's time to address the elephant in the room, and that's cheating. The game has a problem where people can hack their in such a way that they can get you banned without you doing anything wrong at all, basically they will join your game and if they hit you, you will gain excess amounts of souls which will flag your save data as modified, if you do not delete your save file and replace it with a clean backup you will be soft banned which means you'll only be able to play with other soft banned players. Now, the game doesn't support cloud saving (which is completely unacceptable in itself) but you can manually backup your save data and upload it to an online hosting service such as Mediafire, OneDrive or Dropbox, or alternatively you can simply make a backup and keep it on a secondary hard drive or USB stick.How to:Enable hidden foldersNavigate to C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\DarkSoulsIII\\NUMBERSCopy DS30000.sl2Paste DS30000.sl2 wherever you'd like to store itOptional: Upload DS30000.sl2 to an online hosting service, I personally use DropboxYou will need to copy/paste this file regularly, I do it after every major session.Overall the game is truly fantastic with a couple of issues that taint it a little, especially the lack of competent anti cheat but it's still an incredible experience from start to finish with endless replayability and I highly recommend it.9/10Reviewed on: i5 3570k @ 4.4GHz, GTX 970 @ 1373Mhz/1938Mhz, 8GB DDR3 @ 1600MHz, Samsung Evo 850 SSD, Window 10 64bit"

It rewards you for being good at the game and had a lot less of the cheapness of previous games.  Not saying it didn't still have cheap moments but compared to previous versions there are less.  The story overall is cooler as well in this one.  There are more people to have contact with, more lore, more fun mechanics.  Magic has a whole new element to it with MP.  The combat is sped up.  I like it alot.  Nothing really felt new but it was refined."

Everything has its own attack patterns and you need to learn them by method of trying. The satisfaction you get after defeating hard boss is glorious. Storyline is ominous and hard to learn. You can't simply say that it's the hardest of the franchise because as wise people on reddit say: First souls game is the hardest."

I have never felt so convulsed while playing a video game. It has made me feel short of breath as I peered through every dark and narrow opening, hunting for each and every achievement in the game. Dark Souls III has managed to antagonise myself enough for me to be yelling at the computer screen and release unconventional anger. If by any chance, you ever feel as though you should be playing this game, or that you are missing out on something very enjoyable, please do not ruin your life for $60 and just go and entice yourself to GTA V for an extra $15. Type 'PAINKILLER' in the console and you will be smiling like a kid that just lost his virginity.11/10 EXTREMELY rewarding but requires an immense amount of time, patience and persistence.I LOVE you Dark Souls III !"

The combat is the closest a game has gotten to recreating the raw emotions and fear one would feel while in a sword fight to the death, it's great. The game world is just as well made, every corner offers new enimies in varied groups, and a fair share of ambushes and traps, and boss battles that make you learn enemy movesets and call on phantom summons to help you fight. It is hard asâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but if you learn the layout and enemy moves it becomes a task that is more doable and rewardiung to complete. This is a perfect game if you wanna just burn weeks away at a time."

It takes time, but even a complete noob can catch on. Took about 20 hours, but I can tell I'm getting better. Learn somthing from ever time you die. Try somthing new every time you respawn, if something works remember it. The devs probably intended you to fight the enimy in exactly that way. The combat is some of the best I've seen in an RPG. It's depth rivals or surpasses 2.5D fighting games - games that rely solely on thier combat mechanics and offer little else. If you haven't found much depth to the combat you havn't looked hard enough. Do your research! Enviroment is jaw dropping on max settings at 2k - 4k. But, even an GTX 1060 or an RX580 (any GB version) can run this game at max settings on 2k. Framerates are stable 60-50 fps. I'm very impressed.  When I can save up the money, I will buy the DLC."

We often hear that the souls/borne franchise is an extremely hard set of games, and often times, that alienates people from even attempting them. However I'd argue that if played with the right mindset, Souls/Borne and Dark Souls 3 can be one of the most relaxing experiences possible in gaming. If you are able to accept the fact that you are going to die eventually and learn not to dwell on it for too long, the game becomes much more enjoyable. I'd reccomend playing it in short intervals(30 minutes to an hour) and just explore around the world and find a playstyle that interests you.There's no rush to beat the game, and if you do, there are a million more ways you can try to beat it after that."

I discovered the Souls series in May of 2016(around release of this game), and to test the waters picked up Dark Souls 1. In those four months played all 3 games(in order), pouring over 1000 hours into them collectively, and have not been able to spend more than a few hours playing anything else.

        "Comments": "Posted: July 4, 2018              The most enjoyable action (RPG) game I have played so far. The combat is faster than the combat in Dark Souls 1 and 2 and feels very responsive (except when dealing with laggy PvPers unfortunately). The game is visually pleasing and the level design is pretty good. The atmosphere isn't as amazing and mysteriously dark fantasy as the atmosphere in Dark Souls 1, but it is good nonetheless.The unique way of storytelling/lore building (by dividing most of it over a lot of little item descriptions) and the optional questing (NPC's with 'quests' can easily be overlooked and it is very easy to accidentally skip a required step in a questline) make for an atmosphere that I have so far only experienced in the Dark Souls series. Definitely a recommendation for those that enjoy at first not having a clue what's going on, and then having to actively try to piece together the story and lore.Even though the player starts out with a 'class', there are no actual set classes, it's perfectly possible to play as a tanky pyro-sorcerer with a crossbow or greatsword sidearm. The different playstyles and weapons are fun to use, and even though some weapons are underpowered and essentially useless it's still fun to mess around with them at times. Dying and losing fights is almost never unfair, you just have to be a skillful dodger/timer and in some cases have a lot of patience. I say  almost never unfair  because there have been occasions where I died because I was actually fighting the camera angle or camera lock instead of a boss, which seems to happen more often with large non-humanoid creatures.I also mentioned multiplayer. Co-op and PvP are optional and can be a lot of fun, but as with all online-games the quality of online play is also determined by the behaviour of other players and the amount of noticeable lag. I have been playing with friends from The Netherlands (where I live as well) and I haven't had any lag issues, but unfortunately I can't say the same for playing with random, 'public' players. Most of them seem to be laggy to some extend, and in extreme (perhaps intentional?) cases it makes PvPing impossible. We also observed that NPC's appear to suffer from lag for all players as well if only one of the connected players has lag. Overall I can say that playing co-op with friends has been satisfying and PvP can be fun, but the often present lag makes the PvP experience less enjoyable and fair than it could be.Despite little shortcomings, Dark Souls III is a must-have for people looking to play a solid action RPG game. None of the other games I have played come close to being as satisfying and interesting as this one."

There will be moments where you will feel like you've had enough of this bu****it, but those are the best because you will learn to overcome them and grow as a  player.

The PC version  came after 20 days later when PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version were released, then you notice UI still remains the default buttons which were supposed for consoles, which, to my opinion is pretty  unfriendly  to new players.Also, the color display on PC version makes me feel pretty weird, you can tell the screen looks like a extra layer was on the screen, foggy.  After some searchs I found it might due to the adaption for PC version remained the default color correction for consoles, while the later use TVs' screen to output videos.Despite what I've mentioned above, the rest of the game still makes it the best ARPG game of year 2016. I became a real fan of DK series especially after got to know the stories of each NPCs, the original owners of items, what's behind of every loaction, etc. (Spoilers Alert)(Spoilers Alert)I especially enjoy the music while fighting with Slave Knight Gael, and after I knew the story behind him, I was moved, really. He's the only NPC to have lived through all the events of the series and is fought at the literal end of the world! Gael's not the previous one any more, but he'll be Uncle Gale forever!May the flame guide you, Uncle Gael."

Now there are drops in framerate that seem ridiculous considering my system specs, but I'm sure that will be fixed."

No, seriously. Have fun and enjoy."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 9, 2016              This review is one giant rant, butthurt fans go away please. I have played the Souls games for hundreds upon hundreds of hours each, the only one I haven't played is Demons' Souls. I hate on this game because I love this franchise, and i'm willing to see each and every fault in each game, and after playing this game for over 140 hours, I can safely say the following: Is Dark Souls III an enjoyable experience that is worth your money? For the most part, no. First off, the immense lack of polish, this game is a reused asset wonderland. Every player animation, some enemies, most armor sets, weapons, even entire freaking locations and concepts, are reused/rehashed from older titles, I can't find a speck of originality in this game, which is a big goddamn dissapointment. People claim that it's  fanservice  or an  homage  to the older titles, my cynical brain sees it no more as laziness cause they were too busy making the awesomeness that is The Old Hunters DLC for Bloodborne. At least Dark Souls II had the freaking courtesy to refurbish and refine reused armor sets and weapons, such as giving the Elite Knight set a static left pauldron so it wouldn't clip so bad for example, and what do they do in 3? They bring it back, obviously cause they just ripped the armor set straight from Dark Souls 1, and added some physics to the movy bits, just like what they did with every other armor set from older games. Also, bugs, lots of em. This game is so unbelievably poorly optimized that its actually amazing, even people with the recommended graphics card can't run this game. Lag spikes abound, weird enemy/ai glitches, randomâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥all over the place, this game is a bug ridden mess. Next, the gameplay. Fromsoft was sitting in their office thinking to themselves,  Man, people really like Bloodborne, let's just take all the enemies from that game and just put a slowâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Dark Souls 1 PC into that bowl ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥  And that's exactly what they did, pretty much every enemy is annoyingly quick, recovers way too quickly, has way too much health, and kills you in 2-3 hits. In Bloodborne, you have massive speed, a fast, quick-changing weapon, and a gun, to compensate for this, but in a Dark Souls game, you have no such advantage, making every death feel cheap and undeserved. Lothric knights are a good example of what I mean, spamming shield bashes constantly, and attacking faster than a longsword R1, all the while having actual freaking poise. Poise, let's talk about that for a moment.  Working as intended,  they say, apparently all it does now is keep you from losing i-frames on your next roll after being attacked. So basically, poise is useless, there is no benefit to wearing heavy armor anymore, hyper armor is the new poise practically, but all you need for that is a big weapon. This game doesn't promote smart movement or movesets, it promotes a whole lot of quick r1 spam, emphasized by the Dark Sword and Estoc PVP metas. Also, parry frames, they bring back the crappy Dark Souls 2 start up frames, which was fine, in Dark Souls 2 I mean. In 2, enemies were fairly slow and predictable, which warrants the use of startup frames. But in this game, where everything is insanely quick and hard to follow, startup frames makes parrying in PvE a complete hassle, and pointless, when you can just R1 spam and stunlock your way to victory like a goddamn toddler. It's pretty ridiculous when a caestus is more reliable parry weapon than a buckler by the way. I will say, the early introduction of the soapstone, and the red eye orb is a fantastic choice, along with the password system, making this game the most enjoyable souls game to play with friends, the fact that my SL 15 buddy can summon my SL 110 character, and I'll be downleveled to compensate quite nicely, is a great addition and something that was truly needed in past souls games. Theres also the little things, like being able to cancle the roll after a jump, or quick-switching to the first item in your hotbar, that makes this game extremely convenient at times, allowing you to move through your hotbar hassle-free. Also, gestures, despite the fact that most of them are, again, reused assets, they are still a great addition. I wish you had more gesture slots in your hotbar because there are just so many good ones.Im normally not this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥y with souls games, I love the souls series, because when I die in these games, I usually feel at fault, I usually feel like there was something I couldve done to change that situation, and so I try again. But in Dark Souls 3, I just feel cheated, I feel like whatever I do is just luck, a roll of the NPC die (see what I did there) to see whether or not an enemy knight spams like he just snorted 40 lines of cocaine, or if he just sits there and lets me guardbreak him. Each enemy is a freaking roulette wheel. Next, Bosses. Bosses for the most part, suffer the same problems as normal enemies. Your a freaking snailman when compared to any enemy in this game, that goes for the bosses as well. There's the chore bosses like Wolnir and the Cursed Rotted Greatwood, which are never difficult fights, more so incredibly annoying. Also, the bullet hell that is the crystal sages. Fromsoft knows how much everyone loves the cloning magic user boss! They know we love it so much, they made this one actually do some freaking damage, to the point that he'll one shot you if you don't have perfect 360 degree vision (or a summon). The Lords of Cinder are all complete jokes bosses. The Abyss Watchers, a boss with amazing lore, great first encounter, awesome looks, and the best song in the whole damn game, arguably one of the best souls songs of all time, and yet the fight itself is reduced to a clanking ganking spam fest of cheese, full of 7 hit unending combos with perfect tracking. They lack poise, which once again promotes the belove R1 spam, as opposed to actually using your human brain for actual human function. And then they top it all off with a crappy bootleg Maria from Bloodborne, which just adds on top of the already spammy combos. Aldrich is more of a magic spamming nuisance than an actual fight. Yhorm is the most dissapointing, a giant anticlimax to one of the most hyped up fights in the entire game. Lorian and Lothric are the only good fight out of any of them, being incredibly enjoyable and tough at the same time. Theres also the super fast spammers that give you no breathing room, like The Dancer, or Champion Gundyr, pretty much any human-style boss is just a neverending wombo combo spam fest. And the final boss, good ol' cinderbro, is just as spammy and tracking as the rest of em. Its a really neat idea to have a boss use only abilities available to the player. Great idea, horrible execution. You know what game had player-style bosses and did it right? Bloodborne. Gherman, Gascoigne, Maria, all amazing fights, that truly felt like a level playing field. Meanwhile this guys over here, withâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tons of poise, being unparryable, and a having a 65% damage-dealing 6 hit combo in his second phase with insane range and perfect tracking. Fun. All of these fights can feel like a chore, feeling either insanely unfair or cheap on your own, or way too easy and boring with a friend or two. Now, there are plenty of fights that I actually find myself enjoying. Iudex gundyr is always a blast, , Nameless King is always a great endurance battle, Vordt, the Deacons, Dragonslayer Armor, even Pontiff Sulyvahn I feel are all relatively fair and balanced fights that are always enjoyable. Overall, I believe this game is not worth your time. If you're a diehard souls lover, get it on sale, don't pay full price. If you're new to the series thanks to Dark 3's successful marketing, I suggest you spend your time on Dark Souls 1, 2, or Bloodborne first before deciding to pick this one up. Despite what people say, Dark 2 is a great and solid game in my opinion, and perfect for newcomers to the souls series."

I was banned from multiplayer on accusations of cheating/hacking: I have not modified the game in any way whatsoever and From offered no evidence in support of their claims. They won't be getting a dollar from me ever again, and if even 1/4 of the internet is to be believed, I am far from the only one who has been treated this way. Buy this game if you like giving your money to people who then make false accusations and ban you from using a major part of the product you paid them for."

The game is the best one in the entire series, some of the best boss designs(NOT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING OLD DEMON KING THOUGH) so far - mostly well balanced apart from the devs removing poise.Negative because anti cheat. Anti cheat arbitrarily bans innocent players and fails to punish actual hackers(joining the game of a hacker might get you banned or vica versa - going PvP is a huge risk atm). Will not recommend until fixed, this is just a lazy excuse for an anti cheat mechanism and it in fact rapes a large part of the fun because of the potential threat of losing your high level character."

Its environments, combat, and boss fights set the standard for other RPGs. It certainly earns its reputation for difficulty, but it isn't difficult simply because the enemies have a lot of HP or because they do a lot of damage (although they do). To git gud at Dark Souls, you have to learn the attack patterns of the enemies. Learn when to dodge, when to block, when to attack, and when to parry. Figure out a strategy and character build that works for you. When you finally beat a boss, you will know that you earned it.Welcome to Dark Souls. You're gonna die a lot."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 15, 2016              Quite frankly, I don't think Dark Souls 3 is that bad of a game. The first playthrough in singleplayer was a hell of a lot of fun and I was very excited about it at the time. But everything after my first playthrough has just been a disappointment. * There is no replayability to be found in New Game Plus, unlike Dark Souls 2 it is the EXACT same experience, just with your build carried over, and the difficulty hike is laughable. The only new thing is + versions of rings, which as a result makes going through the entirety of NG++ a highly important thing in PvP whether you want to play the campaign three times in a row or not. * But you shouldn't want to, quite frankly, because the PvP is just not fun. Dark Souls 2's PvP was a blast, I have nearly 400 hours put into Dark Souls 2 as a result. But in Dark Souls 3 it's regressed in so many ways, it's not funny. I'm pretty much done with it, I don't want to play any more of it at this point.* Magic is less fun. There are fewer spells, and offensive magic is incredibly underpowered and basically pointless in PvP. Dark Magic has just been retconned to hell and has as much presence as it did in Dark Souls 1. * The game on the current patch version (1.04.1) has real stutter issues UNIVERSALLY, every player seems to have them (myself included). * The game's cheat protection is still very flawed, and prevents community fixes like PvP Watchdog by Eur0pa and other mods from being developed while contributing little.* There is a reduced selection of weapons compared to Dark Souls 2 and many weapons are completely unviable in PvP, whereas almost any weapon could be viable in Dark Souls 2.* The covenants in the game are uninspired and some don't even work. I've not been summoned once for the blue sentinels or the darkmoon blades throughout my entire time with the game and the only alternative to getting the rewards involves a multitude of hours of soul-numbing farming.* The game rehashes Dark Souls 1's content far too much, while dismissing Dark Souls 2 almost entirely.* It also has almost no original memorable NPCs, the only memorable NPCs in the game are straight from Dark Souls 1. The NPC questlines are also another level of convoluted, they take the cryptic nature of the souls series too far.* One of Dark Souls 2's main criticisms was the regressed level design, relying on bonfire warping instead of intricate shortcut based interconnected levels. While Dark Souls 3 makes much more sense geographically, the level design suffers from the same issue. Memorable shortcuts are countable on one hand. * Power stancing has been ditched, making dual-wielding any weapons other than the pre-designed dual-wielded weapons completely useless. While a few of the special dual-wielded weapons are quite cool, they do nothing that couldn't've been done with power stancing left in place. * The game also seems strangely cpu-reliant. My framerate is sub-60 in a lot of areas on an i5 4690k @ 4.5GHz and a Sapphire Tri-X R9 290, and turning down the graphics from maximum to minimum has little-to-no effect on my framerate. I think my cpu should be perfectly powerful enough to run the game at 60 frames per second, but what do I know.All in all, there's a rant for you. If you're a souls fan no doubt you've already bought this game. And if you intend to make this game your first Dark Souls experience, I imagine you'd have a lot of fun with it as I did during my first playthrough. So I don't think this review will be useful for a lot of people. But I still wanted to write it, if anything just to vent my frustrations with the game somewhere."

Although, the bosses in this game can't live up to the bosses of dark souls 1, some of the bosses are really easy too. Even the optional ones. NG+ is pretty easy once you get rapport as well. A spell that makes the ai fight for you. I just like darks souls 1 more I guess. Pvping is a joke, invasions used to be fun but now it is just a frustrating ordeal. You can say  git gud  but try doing that against 3 people, pretty unfair for the invader that already has half health. However I played the games for the pve aspect since demon souls came out, so pvping isn't a big deal to me. It is really fun to play and you should play it too."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 12, 2016              This is a hard review for me to write. I love the Souls games, I love Bloodborne and I love Demon's souls. I've double dipped on buying each game multiple times and (obviously) played this one several times to completion itself. It's not even that this game is bad, it's just that with the option of any other game developed by From Software of it's type, there is absolutely no way I can recommend this game to anyone who has the option of getting one of the other games. I wanted to write this review mostly to say simply that if you get in on playing dark souls with this one then you'll miss out on what's so good about the series, even if the game has made great strides to being more accessible, this is not even close to the best souls experience you can have. If you have access to a ps4, Bloodborne is my favourite PvE experience of all the souls games, and the first game is still worth a playthrough. This game and its handling of poise and heavy nerfing of magic/faith scaling until outrageous levels also makes the PvP much less interesting, and for that there is Dark Souls 2, despite not liking the adaptability mechanic, that game allows for many more fun builds, in my opinion."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 18, 2016              Dark Souls at it's finest.This is the best game From Software has put out to date. They've improved the mechanics from the other Souls games to create a more fluid, visceral combat by taking pages out of their Bloodborne playbook. The level design and locales are better designed than ever before. There's a lot less  artificial difficulty  in this game when compared to previous games. Almost everything in the game can be countered with skill, even if unexpected. Not nearly as many treacherous ledges, or enemies hiding somewhere you cannot see them no matter how much you turn the camera, while they wait to strike and one-shot you. Don't get me wrong, these things still happen. Just not as much. Art direction is superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful. I really like the boss fights as well. Not many gimmick fights. Just one, really. Cons for this game are pretty limited. Camera does the player a disservice in some instances, but it's probably intentional. Music is not nearly as engaging as previous entries, but I suppose that's not necessarily a bad thing to some, even if it all sounds relatively alike. The plot is still mostly non-existant, and hidden behind a few sentences on some items that you may or may not find as you progress. It's taken three full games (two really, since they mostly ignore DS2) to build up to a half-formed idea of a story. What's there is pretty cool, but even with what's given crafting some idea of the story will only lead you with half answers or ideas, and you're often left filling in blanks with whatever you come up with in your head. On PC, the online is bad. There are a lot of cheaters out there now. Wasn't the case when I started playing, but it's only getting worse, so beware. Honestly though, I feel like those complaints aren't really a big deal, outside of the MP. The story is very obviously an afterthought, as it's not a story driven game. The camera doesn't bug me so much because it's pretty rare for it to really get bad, and these games are mostly trial and error anyway. The music I had to listen to after I played the game on the soundtrack, because I was so engrossed in the experience I couldn't even think of the tunes. It's a very finely crafted game, and I think everyone should give it a go, and not be discouraged by dying here and there.It earns a very hearty recommendation from me."

You are one of the unkinded, awakened from your eternal slumber to link the fire and preserve the light from the coming age of darkness through sacrifice and toil, where all others have failed. The task ahead of you: to find the four Lords of Cinder, those who were mighty enough to link the eternal flame, and return them to their towering thrones, through the only way which they can understand: violence. These four lords reside in lairs woven throughout your adventures, in such breathtaking landscapes as massive regal throne room of the Twin Princes, or the chamber of the Abyss Watchers, filled with corpses of the fallen. In Dark Souls III if you see a location off in the background then chances are youâll be going there at some point during your quest. Not only do the locations get increasingly captivating as the game progresses, the enemies do as well, becoming more and more interesting and challenging as you near the end of your great journey. Exploring Lothric is a joy like no other, but what sets Dark Souls III out as a true gem among other such Role Playing Games is that not only will the world fill you with joy to explore, but in many cases will also fill you with terror.Enemies, Areas, and Secrets: Oh My!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1185401586 In Dark Souls III you can count the amount of beings that donât want you dead on one hand, ensuring that your quest will not be as easy as you may have thought. Enemies in Dark Souls III can be likened to puzzle pieces, each with their own backstory and every single one of them connected. Dark Souls III not only builds an exemplary game, but an enthralling world behind it just as well, absolutely no easy feat. There is no main storyline youâre following other than the quest to return the four lords of cinder to their thrones, instead Dark Souls opts to give even the most miniscule part of their world a backstory and a place in the universe as a whole. The best way that I can describe this is that Fromsoft seems to have designed every enemy in the game as if they were a boss, not in difficulty, but in the amount of work and story standing behind them. Dark Souls III has also managed a level of environmental design that few others have ever come near, rarely can a game balance the looks of an area, with how that area flows and connects with the rest of the game. Dark Souls IIIâs areas are filled with nooks and crannies brimming with goodies to be snatched up and put to use, many of which are so secret you wonât notice, or know how to get to them, on your first playthrough. The sheer amount of secret or hidden items and areas that Dark Souls III has is mind-boggling. Sets of armor which you have to do a hidden questline to obtain, zones and bosses that you can easily miss, all of these await throughout the perilous walks of Lothric. Thereâs this indescribable feeling of both satisfaction and glee you get after noticing a secret alcove or nab that out of reach piece of armor that encourages even further exploration. A critical part of every environment, one often ignored or unnoticed, is how everything in it sounds. Dark Souls III has some exemplary sound effects that enhance both the gameplay and the whole experience both inside and outside of battle. Not only are the sound effects definitely worthy of high praise, the same can be said for the music. In the more sinister areas, the music helps build tension, while in frantic boss battles it helps to keep the adrenaline flowing and ends up as one of the most memorable parts of the fight. There arenât really a whole lot of games with a soundtrack so good I would pay money to have it, Hotline Miami and Payday 2 being notable examples, however I find myself adding Dark Souls III to that list as well. The soundtrack doesnât just make the fighting and the ambience better, it adds to the characters, the bosses, in ways that arenât tangible or really there. This sounds like Iâm insane, a charge to which I plead the fifth, but just hearing a bosses soundtrack youâll feel as if you know them, and in some cases you may even regret putting them down. Music is a part of many games, but in Dark Souls III, in Lothric, itâs not a part of the game, itâs a part of a living, breathing world.Hack, Slash, Die, Repeathttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1185402621&fileuploadsuccess=1 Now after all of that talking about the environments, music, and how Dark Souls III feels you may be wondering, isnât this a game? Shouldnât there be gameplay? There most definitely is. Dark Souls III has some of the most fluid combat Iâve ever seen in a souls game, making it enjoyable to play, not just enjoyable to walk through. The combat hasnât changed much from previous souls games, with some notable exceptions, but that absolutely does not mean itâs any easier to master, this is Dark Souls after all. A major change from the other souls games is that in Dark Souls III you now have a mana bar for casting pyromancies, spells, and miracles, forcing you to split your total estus flasks into health flasks and mana flasks. You choose how many estus flasks you want to be mana flasks and how many you want to be health flasks, so you arenât being forced to either use spells or hold on to useless estus. The biggest change though is the combat: combat in Dark Souls III takes heavy inspiration from Bloodborne and is significantly faster paced any other souls game. Dodging costs less stamina, the enemies are significantly more aggressive, and as a general rule everything seems to move much faster than previous games. This is a welcome change and makes the combat flow a lot better and just generally more fluid, helping to make the game seem more fair. Thereâs also the PvP to consider, though I wonât talk much about this because that just isnât my thing, so I didnât play much of it. Player versus player combat in Dark Souls III from what I can tell is just about the same as itâs always been, however the cooperative experience has been massively improved. They got rid of the dysfunctional soul rating system from Dark Souls II, now you can be summoned just about anywhere and by just about anyone, though you can regulate this by creating a password that your partner needs to match in order to connect. With such options you now have the ability to actually control your co-op experience, rather than using the needlessly complex systems forced upon you in the previous game. That seems to be a big theme with Dark Souls III: controlling everything. You control your co-op experience, you control the battlefield with the new and improved combat, and you control the power to link the flame. All you have to do, is find it.TL;DRDark Souls III is a not just a game, but an experience that pulls you in like a mimic and wonât ever let go.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming"

A good balance of each qualities of those two.Fights are impressive and the difficulty is definitly here without being absurd, only punitive as intended.DLCs are really worth it. Outstanding lore and difficulty.I can only make two complains: - usual laggy multiplayer- NG+ are fairly easy, more than the first run. Except for the DLCs."

        "Comments": "Posted: January 3, 2018              I want to make a post addressing all of the new bad reviews for dark souls 3, as they fit neatly into 4 categories.  The first is that the game is too hard.  This would be understandable from new players, but I've seen people who claim to be veterans say the same.  I am a newish player.  I only got into the souls series in the last couple of months.  Dark Souls 3 is not hard.  I am not saying this to be facetious, I am being legitimate.  It is challenging, but there is a difference.  Like all souls games, if you find yourself doing really poorly over and over again, there is probably an easier way to do what you are trying.  For example, I see many people playing ds3 with their shield up and just circle strafing.  That works well in ds2.  In ds3, the dodge key is your friend, and your shield will betray you.  Try a more active playstyle.  I hate to say  git gud,  but if you are playing passively and haven't noticed how fast the enemies are in ds3, you are either new, or have no idea how to adapt.The second argument people have is that the controls are poorly optimized for pc.  To these people, I have to question if you actually play on pc.  The reason is it should be obvious that you can rebind keys.  It took me no time at all to find a configuration I enjoyed.  For those saying go to console... I have to question your sanity.  You have a pc.  You can plug in a controller if you just can't be asked (though I can confirm the game is way easier on keyboard and mouse once you set the keys right).  I will even point you in the right direction.  set 'q' as interact, and 'e' as both back out and use items.  It works wonders.  Also, if your mouse has extra buttons, use them for power attacks so you can pull off weapon arts easier, as those are the only thing awkward with keyboard controls.  You can get a cheap 4 dollar mouse from cyberpower pc of decent quality for gaming that has two side buttons, so cost shouldn't be an issue.The third issue people have is graphical.  I'm sorry, but ds3 is a graphically intense game.  You might not be able to run it on ultra settings.  It isn't an optimization issue, you just have your settings too high.  I can pretty much garauntee that if your card fits the minimum requirements for this game though, that you can at least achieve console quality.  Obviously you can crank it up far above that with better cards.  Stop saying go back to console, you have the better version, its bad advice.The final issue I have seen in the reviews is people saying  too many cheaters, go back to console,  or  too much lag, go back to console.   I group these two together for a reason.  I have yet to come across a single cheater.  It is exceedingly rare, because the anticheat software for this game is very good.  People seem to think that just because its pc, it's easier to cheat.  easier is relative.  It's still extremely difficult, and will still get you banned REALLY quick.  As for the lag, I hate to tell you this, but it is just as bad everywhere.  Every youtube video I see for pvp has at least one lagger, no matter the system.  There is no magical  lag free  system, because people all over the world play this.  I can say that ds3 will probably in the long run have the least lag on pc, because pc gamers tend to latch onto games longer and play them after the console market has moved on (this has to do with the way marketing is done to console gamers, as well as backwards compatibility in many cases).In other words, stop blaming these issues on the game, it's brilliant. It has its flaws, but these are not them.  You need to, and I know you saw this coming, git gud scrub."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 12, 2016              One of the best things about Dark Souls 1 was that it walked a fine line between difficulty and insanity. DS1 was hard, but fair - you learned, you became better.DS3 is not fair. It does not walk that line. Be prepared for raging, anger, frustration. Be prepared for enemies with infinite poise, fast rolling in heavy armor. Be prepared for sudden ambushes that you cannot predict or see. Be prepared for giant hitboxes that make no sense with AOE  that gives no warning.Dark Souls 1 is one of my favourite games, and i've played it through and through. The fact that i almost - almost - rage quit DS3 at one point should tell you a lot. Pros: - Great story and setting- Great storytelling- Good performanceCons:- Terrible gameplay- Terrible balance- Meh endings, compared to how good the game lore was"

        "Comments": "Posted: June 14, 2016              Dark Souls III is currently the latest game in the Dark Souls series. If this is your first Dark Souls game, you need to know that Dark Souls is well-known for its extremely hard difficulty, frustrating deaths, and slow grinding progress (because you'll lose everything if you fail to retrieve your dropped souls - or 'money'). In short, it's just completely merciless to the player. If you're a hardcore gamer that loves challenges, I heavily recommend this for you. Dark Souls is the type of game where the difficulty overwhelms the fun, so if you're a casual gamer looking to rekt some AIs easily and be a hero that saves the universe - don't buy this game. Know that your character will die a lot in this game. I mean, A LOT. So if you're the type of person that crushes things around you when you're frustrated, I also don't recommend this game for you to save your stuff.GameplayYou'll start with creating your character and choosing a class. And then, the slaughtering will start. Arguably overpowered enemies - usually in the form of monsters - will start popping out as you progress through the map and you'll gain 'souls' when you defeat them. You can spend your collected souls as soon as you find some kind of a 'checkpoint', usually in the form of a large area that consists of a blacksmith, a store, a bonfire (respawn point), and an NPC to upgrade your stats. You'll get to purchase weapons, armors, power-ups, stats, etc. in these checkpoints to give you a better fighting chance against the enemies. Each time you die, you'll drop ALL of your collected souls and you'll have to retrieve it the next time you respawn. If you die again, then you'll not be able to retrieve the souls you collected the first time you died. Only the last pack of souls will be dropped and retrievable. When you successfully dominates an 'area', you'll have to beat a boss fight to gain access to the next 'area'. Usually, the bosses are extremely overpowered and it'll take more than 10 retries to beat them. This is basically what you'll do the whole game. Walk - kill enemies - die - grind souls - die - purchase stuff - fight bosses - die - repeat.AdvantagesGraphics are way better than Dark Souls II. It's really nice to look at and overall, it's great. The main advantage of the game is the difficulty. Some of you, like me, may think  What? Who finds getting killed over and over again, getting frustrated, punching stuff around you, or even throwing your CPU out of the window because you are p*ssed off as 'fun'? . Well, people have different ideas of 'fun'. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of players that loves the Dark Souls franchise. The overwhelming difficulty is what makes Dark Souls unique. Its PS4-only cousin, Bloodborne, also gained huge attention from gamers due to similar gameplay style. I personally don't find getting killed over and over again or fighting against overpowered enemies as 'fun' but I find the game greatly trains my mentality - it desensitized me from failure, which will be important in my pursue of success. But know this: this game is not all about death and failures. You'll learn how to fight with your brain instead of blindly slashing everywhere. Yes, Dark Souls is skill-based. You'll have to get used on using the roll, heavy slash, light slash, shields, bows, utiliteies, etc. if you want to be able to progress through the game. They are not easy at all to master.DisadvantagesStoryline is confusing. It's best not to put your hope on the story-driven part. The game lacks explanation about the previous installment stories. You can always look at YouTube to catch up with the stories but IMHO, it's not a nicely written story. It's short, lacks details, lacks plot twists, and it's just way too 'mainstream and predictable'. As for the soundtrack, it's empty as usual. I expected epic songs for these kinds of games but apparently, they still think almost-no-soundtracks is good. The overwhelming difficulty itself is NOT a disdvantage - it is purely based on your gaming style preference. The second noticable disadvantage is the lack of new weapons in the shops. I may not have progressed far but when I meet a 'checkpoint',  I couldn't find anything useful in there. I might have to enchant weapons and all but I haven't quite understood the mechanism. Should it be a disadvantage? I don't know. I might be too stupid to understand the whole mechanism in 5 hours or maybe the game itself lacks tutorials for new players that are not familiar with Dark Souls.Final VerdictIt all depends on your gaming preference. Some people enjoy Dark Souls, some people don't. Make sure you look at the gameplay first on YouTube or whatever before purchasing this game just to make sure you won't waste your money. I personally like this game and recommend it for everyone regardless of your gaming preference because everyone needs to be desensitized from failures. But you might think it's not necessary because you already have a super safe life and a tremendous amount of parent's money. Just make sure you watch the gameplay first before purchasing it."

Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic entry in the series but instead of standing on its own, it feels more like a nostalgic romp and because of this ends on a less climactic note than I wouldâve preferred.Pros:- Replay Value- Fast Based- Soundtrack- WeaponsCons:- Season Pass cash grab- Bosses- Magic- Side Quests/ characters- Story - Armor- Poise?5/10It Could Have Been Better. -IDNWTR"

If the game works great for you it won't for long or you're simply lucky.I do really enjoy the faster paced combat and weapon arts. Hate to say anything positive tbh considering my extreme level of disappointment with what happened at launch. For me, the problem is a memory leak issue with the game causing fps drop and freezes with others reporting this as well, game runs smooth (not DS2 perfect though) when I have no other program open on my comp.From Software needs to learn how to make games for PC. Dark Souls had aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of problems at launch as well. You think they would have learned from their mistakes...I am playing and having fun with DS3 for the most part, although so far it is the worst in the series mainly due to small, lame, level design and Bloodbourne copied enemies, it is the most poorly optimized game on the planet atm.What a slap in the face overall, seriously. I'll never buy another From title for more than 10 bucks. Fool me once with DS2 and DS2.5, and again with DS3's beyond horrible launch...never again."

Dark Souls 3 could be the very best yet, but it isn't. Due to a single, but overwhelmingly obvious oversight, this game is not currently worth the time it takes to play. I praised the previous games in the series for giving the player the choice on how to play, how to build their soul slaying hero.Dark Souls 3 forces the player into specializing their offensive capabilites but gives them no choice on defense. Blocking, and wearing heavy armor, no longer serve a purpose. The only viable options for defense are to roll out of the way or parry. Some people will read this rant and say  git gud  but believe me... I am good. I'm pretty awesome at this game, but I felt like my choices were stripped from me as I was forced to adapt to the Iframes given during rolls and the activation frames of various parrys. In previous games you could choose to simply invest in equipment load and build yourself a heavy armored tank, this is no longer an option as the weakest enemies in the game will stagger you in 1 shot, and a dagger wielding invader can stunlock you to death.PoisePoise is what is missing in Dark Souls 3Poise is a vital part of the series to date.Poise is the only reason I am not recommending this game.If Poise isn't important to you or if you were planning on making a light armor, ninja esque styled character or a mage in robes then you probably won't notice or care. But, for those who want a bad A$$ in Havels armor strutting around, brushing off attacks without a care in the world... go play dark souls 1 or 2, they're great games still, and they have poise."

Only thing that I knew is that games are hard. Well I bought Dark Souls 3 and I see why others are hooked. So many secrets, hidden areas and mistery lore that even the biggest Dark Souls fans still try to figure it out. You will be hungry for more and more. Which area is next? What will it bring to you? Which boss is there? What is the lore of this area/monsters/boss? A loot in the distance, how to get to it? Is it maybe rubbish or some cool armor? So many questions.Do yourself a favor and play Dark Souls 3. Play it blind, try not to look at wikis maybe even avoid the CO-OP for your first time through. It'll make victory all the sweeter. <3I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 10/10"

Because so many cheaters not only happy with editing their own files but also want to do so to others. They are able to use such as CE to craft a weapon which is not belong to the game, and this kind of weapon can achieve consequences like one-shot kill or 'back to level-1'. This very negative phenomenon causes many legal players banned by the system mentioned above when it identifies any 'invalid' date in their own files.What makes me even angry is, the game operators do not give aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥about it, especially for the customers in PC. They even stated that this is only our faults to 'play with' or 'recieve gifts from' thoes inappropiate players. However, could you plz tell me how can I avoid being invaded by these players? How can I know they are the ones? Someone might argue that  YOU CAN JUST TRUN OFF THE ON-LINE PLAY OPTION. Yes, I can, if the online content is optional, I would rather ask a refund for castrating this content off.To sum up, if you really love this game and you like pvp and/or any other online game-plays,  PC VERSION IS THE LAST OPTION."

They also seem hesitant on fixing either one of these issues, and, instead, blaming their consumers.I thought you were better than this, Bandai. Come on. Placing the blame on players for taking advantage of an in-game feature that's MEANT to be taken advantage of? Seriously? I don't care how good your game is if you're gonna be that irresponsible with it, this level of laziness and negligence cannot be condoned.Edit: Is everyone marking the review as  not helpful  looking at nothing but the red thumbs down and the playtime, and ignoring what the actual review says? Seriously. Again, I don't  hate the game  like some people are suggesting, I hate Bandai's management of it and find a large part of its functionality and content not worth the risk of using because of the way they're doing things. It's the equivalent of serving people frozen or undercooked food in a restaurant and then saying  oh, well, you should've checked the food more thoroughly and brought a portable microwave before buying  after they complain. Developers should not be allowed to place the blame of their own malfunctioning products on the buyers."

Until the technical problems are fixed, DS 3 can not be recommended.Update: Setting the  Lighting quality  to low fixed the crashing problems at the bonfires.Update #2 (28.04.16): The Bonfire Crash Bug seems to be solved.  Technically it's still not a masterpiece, it stutters sometime for no reason, but it seems to be playable. I don't tested the online part yet and due to the fact that others claim that it's flooded with cheaters which can get you softbanned, i also don't want to. (BUT i cannot guarantee these claims)So if you just want to play the game offline, it's quite nice, if want the full souls experience, you should maybe wait until From fixes the above mentioned problem with the online part."

This game is very good even excellent at times. The design is amazing, all the way from the characters to the structures but the places dont feel THAT different while playing. Maybe because of the tint thats in the game or maybe because they like using stones as their main building block. I wish the story was more clearly told. There are channels based on dark souls's lore so i do know that theres a lot of detailed story but i wish that there was more that was give clearly to you. Of course you die a lot in this game. Sometimes i feel that its harded than it should be even when playing with friends. I wish that you could just play with freinds instead of having to finish the game twice if you want to play with someone else. What i mean is that at every mission you have to summon your friend and for him to accept he needs to be in the same place which means that he needs to finish the missions that are before this one meaning you can leave him to do it himself or you can go to his world and help him, Of course i feel that no-one will ask there friend to help them without helping his friend himself. Overall i like the game more than i thought i would.Score:8.5/10"

The framerate, regardless of rig/settings is inconsistent at best, and more akin to seconds per frame at best. Having tested it on low and high end rigs, I can confirm it is most certainly NOT a hardware fault. Yet another example of a botched PC port. Fix it From. This game would be awesome were it not so graphically wishy-washy. And I paid good money for it too."

Such is the way of things.   Seeker of fire, conquerer of Dark. I too sought fire, once. With fire, they say, a true king can harness the curse.   One day fire will fade, and dark will become a curse. Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally.   ...And now only embers remain  We go thought countless of ancient kingdoms only to see the remnants. We are no longer  the chosen undead  who should link the fire. We are now the  The chosen one  to get those before us who linked the fire to return to their thrones.What happened to the first chosen undead? Did he ever find rest by linking the fire, or is he also one of the Lords of Cinder. Gwyn was the first Lord of Cinder and the one who brought this curse to us. but should we blame him? He did it by fear, to protect his beloved kingdom. He clinged to what he hold dear but what he did not realize is that all he did was spreading a terrible curse. Gwyn links the First flame because he trembled at the Dark, he clung to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans, and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them, Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature. By sacrificing himself to link the fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans so that the Age of Fire may be perpetuated. Gwyn did this only after all other options had been exhausted, after the Witch of Izalith failed to recreate a new First Flame using her soul. Gwyn made what we call the first sin, and the first chosen undead took his place by either relinking the fire or letting it fade. In a future we get the first look of Drangleic. A kingdom made great by a great king, but remnants of the past seeks their return. The Iron king who got the Old king soul, which connects to Gwyn's soul. The Rotten which connects to Gravelord Neto. The Chaos trying to rise again from the depths. And Queens which are remnants of the Father of the Abyss. The story once again repeats itself, but not with the king sacrificing himself. instead he runs from his purpose, and when you arrive, nothing but a hollow is walking around. Now we are in Lothric the Curse is back and we meet many broken souls. This journey is quite the trip down the memories. We found Mushroom people, thus dead but still to be found. we find old characters that reminds us of those we seeked to help but lost non the less. The black knights of Gwyn still wander around without purpose, forever cursed. One Battle took my feelings by storm though. The battle with the abyss walker. a broken yet willing to fight man. when i fought this man he fought like he was a remnant of knight Artorias. The wolf covenant is a remnant of Sif in my mind. Even a stray demon can be found and it's soul made to Havel's ring. Even though my journey is not fully ended, i will try to find all those small objects that brings us back to where it all started. With the first four souls. Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow."

And You know what? The game doesn't even run in 30 FPS on Minimal settings + Very low Resolution (1280x720).To be honest? Dark Souls 3 is a great game, combat system, the feel of unease and everything else. But it just drives You insane, that You are not able to play the game the way it was meant to be played, with all the dynamic lightning, shadows, shaders etc. As I previously stated, my computer has much higher specs than those recommended for Max settings, still can't get 30 FPS on minimum settings. I really hope You guys fix this, I trusted You and pre-ordered the game. No other game released in the 2015/2016 season has that performance problem as the one that DS3 Has. I will update my review once its fixed...Check carefully, before buying guys, if the game will run as You desire."

I've recently started playing again, and I'm really justâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that I didn't just respec as a pure STR build and git gud. I am having a blast playing this game. Yes yes it can be very frustrating, but overall I'm having a lot of more fun with it than anything else. I played the first souls game on my 360 when it came out, and fell in love with the series. This game defintely feels more the successor for DS1 for me personally. It's not as good, no, but this is the most fun I've had in a game for a very long time. Not to mention the game looks â¥â¥â¥â¥ing beautiful.

        "Comments": "Posted: May 23, 2016              The Game is a solid [8/10]:Must have to any fan in the series, Also I highly recommend the game to players looking for challenge:Story (7/10): - It's not your traditional story... not much is there Ashen one.  - Also this game requires digging to find out the quest threads, I have finished NG and I did not do any quests yet.Gameplay (8/10): [Boss Fights]  - I think that the Bosses of DS1/DS2 are much better than that in DS3. More variaty & interesting... - DS3 I did not feal that epicness of winning a boss battle. I think it's somewhat the easiest in the series. [Enemies] - In General: The world of Dark Souls enjoys some of the best enemies brought into Video games, the variety is great and the technices involved are also excellent on taking enemies. - I think that DS2 had the best variaety of enemies, with more unique approaches. - DS3, did not build on DS2 structure of approaching enemies especialy [SOTFS] version. - DS1 had these Black Nights scattered early and felt like a great challenge. the Metal Boar... DS2 had these big animal creatures and Knights as well... DS3 did not have much on that front. [NG+ and so on] - In General: DS games extend the replayability of the their games by allowing you to start New game Plus each time you finish the game. You can play differently, grow your character futher and even try different endings. this is a great feature from the Dark souls game that adds great value to the game. - Biggest dissapointment for me, just increased health / damage for enemies with added rings of +1... and so on. Sorry but DS2 SOTFS had a much more interesting NG+ with better changes... this is putting off.  [World] - In general: the Wold of Dark Souls 3 is well crafted and at some points brings a dark Fantasy to life. - I think that DS1 Had the ultimate connectivity were most maps are interlinked. While DS3 still felt too broad. - DS2 had very interesting areas and despite the feeling of disconnect between. - DS3 is like a mixed bag between the 2, it did not really surpace the world of DS2 and not it's as connected as DS1. - Some times it felt that the area's are also just too big (e.g.: The Farron poisenous Swamp). - DS1 Assylem return remains the best hidden area in the series. - Secrets are scattered however nothing felt revolutioanry.  [Death] - The challenge is in the death system, you must run to gain your  unspent experience (Souls) gained before you die again or you loose it forever! it's awesome.   - In general I prefered the hollowing in DS2 more than DS3/DS1. DS1 was too puniching with the humanity counter.[Multiplayer] - Best MP in a video game ever for me. I love the DS system. - You can summen people to help you and you can help others. - You could get invaded (part of the challenge). - You can join covenants to defend areas, attack people, or even to be summoned and defend other players when they are invaded. - The game's easy mode is it's co-up modes... - Other things make this game alife (and like with other DS games). you can see the ghosts of dead players, you can see the ghosts of players near you...Control (9.5/10) - This is still my favourate Action/RPG with solid & precise controls. - I did not play this with a keyboard & mouse as I only use KB/M for strategy / FPS. I enjoyed the game with an XBOXONE Controller. It feels natural with that. - Added Camera Control (8/10): - In general Camera Control can tend to be challenging especially when you are being cornered, however this is normal with this kind of games. - Overall it's still good.Graphics, Overall: (8.5/10): - Art Style: Dark Phatasy, a more crisp Dark Souls I style. - Optimization: I ran this game on my GTX 980 and it run perfectly on Max / 1080p - Atmosphere: Not as enhanting as DS1, however it's still good.Sound, Overall 6.5/10: - The game utilizes music at selected parts / areas. sometimes it gets too quit. - Boss Music fights is good though.... There is a lot to say about this game, just enjoy it for yourself."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 18, 2016              Karas' Dark Souls 3 - ReviewAs I am writing this review I would like to mention beforehand that I have not played Demon Souls, DS1 nor DS2. Before I bought DS3, I was rather sceptical about it- about wether I would even like it or not, and worrying that it might become a game I would end up disliking completely and never finish it. And in the beginning, I actually came close to that moment. To the moment, where I felt like I wanted to give up. To the moment, where I became tired of fighting the first boss over and over again, only to be stomped into the ground and die. Over and over again. Thankfully, I kept trying. After some practice, enough attempts and luck I was able to beat the first boss. From that point onwards I discovered the Firelink Shrine, the comfortable home-base, and all it's features. I started to like the game more and more. The level-design, the large variety of enemies and bosses, with a lot of them bearing new challenging tactics, movesets and combos,  the architecture, the different environments you get to discover...and so on.As of now, while I am writing this review, I have over 200 hours in this game. I'm on NG+. Short summary:Positive:+Gameplay Tutorial+Design+Epic Fights+Interesting enemies and bosses+Interesting lore and backgrounds to discover+Lots of weapons and armor (and magic)+Higher difficulty than in most RPG's+Co-Op+PvPNegative:-Discovering/Completing all questlines can require more than one playthrough-Questlines and possible outcomes sometimes hard and nearly impossible to foresee-No endless load of quests like you might be used to after playing other RPG's"

I am pulling off 60 fps @ 4k, but as a result, my computer is being pushed pretty hard. My PC is running from 70-80 degrees, and I have never come across another game that makes my computer this hot. It still doesn't look THAT great... so yeah. Kind of dissapointed in the port. Still, this is a great game! Just going to wait for a patch."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 23, 2016              The Game is a solid [8/10]:Must have to any fan in the series, Also I highly recommend the game to players looking for challenge:Story (7/10): - It's not your traditional story... not much is there Ashen one.  - Also this game requires digging to find out the quest threads, I have finished NG and I did not do any quests yet.Gameplay (8/10): [Boss Fights]  - I think that the Bosses of DS1/DS2 are much better than that in DS3. More variaty & interesting... - DS3 I did not feal that epicness of winning a boss battle. I think it's somewhat the easiest in the series. [Enemies] - In General: The world of Dark Souls enjoys some of the best enemies brought into Video games, the variety is great and the technices involved are also excellent on taking enemies. - I think that DS2 had the best variaety of enemies, with more unique approaches. - DS3, did not build on DS2 structure of approaching enemies especialy [SOTFS] version. - DS1 had these Black Nights scattered early and felt like a great challenge. the Metal Boar... DS2 had these big animal creatures and Knights as well... DS3 did not have much on that front. [NG+ and so on] - In General: DS games extend the replayability of the their games by allowing you to start New game Plus each time you finish the game. You can play differently, grow your character futher and even try different endings. this is a great feature from the Dark souls game that adds great value to the game. - Biggest dissapointment for me, just increased health / damage for enemies with added rings of +1... and so on. Sorry but DS2 SOTFS had a much more interesting NG+ with better changes... this is putting off.  [World] - In general: the Wold of Dark Souls 3 is well crafted and at some points brings a dark Fantasy to life. - I think that DS1 Had the ultimate connectivity were most maps are interlinked. While DS3 still felt too broad. - DS2 had very interesting areas and despite the feeling of disconnect between. - DS3 is like a mixed bag between the 2, it did not really surpace the world of DS2 and not it's as connected as DS1. - Some times it felt that the area's are also just too big (e.g.: The Farron poisenous Swamp). - DS1 Assylem return remains the best hidden area in the series. - Secrets are scattered however nothing felt revolutioanry.  [Death] - The challenge is in the death system, you must run to gain your  unspent experience (Souls) gained before you die again or you loose it forever! it's awesome.   - In general I prefered the hollowing in DS2 more than DS3/DS1. DS1 was too puniching with the humanity counter.[Multiplayer] - Best MP in a video game ever for me. I love the DS system. - You can summen people to help you and you can help others. - You could get invaded (part of the challenge). - You can join covenants to defend areas, attack people, or even to be summoned and defend other players when they are invaded. - The game's easy mode is it's co-up modes... - Other things make this game alife (and like with other DS games). you can see the ghosts of dead players, you can see the ghosts of players near you...Control (9.5/10) - This is still my favourate Action/RPG with solid & precise controls. - I did not play this with a keyboard & mouse as I only use KB/M for strategy / FPS. I enjoyed the game with an XBOXONE Controller. It feels natural with that. - Added Camera Control (8/10): - In general Camera Control can tend to be challenging especially when you are being cornered, however this is normal with this kind of games. - Overall it's still good.Graphics, Overall: (8.5/10): - Art Style: Dark Phatasy, a more crisp Dark Souls I style. - Optimization: I ran this game on my GTX 980 and it run perfectly on Max / 1080p - Atmosphere: Not as enhanting as DS1, however it's still good.Sound, Overall 6.5/10: - The game utilizes music at selected parts / areas. sometimes it gets too quit. - Boss Music fights is good though.... There is a lot to say about this game, just enjoy it for yourself."

I truly don't believe From Software could've done it any better. Playing it for the 3rd time round, still absolutely adore this game <3Pro's Addictively good questline Flexible levelling system Best bosses in the series (in my opinion) Great travelling system Awesome integration of shortcuts and checkpoints Genius level design Fantastic use of optional areas Sexual levels of nostalgiaCon'sSomewhat frequent frame dropsSometimes underwhelming boss fightsThat's literally f*cking it go buy it nowEven if you've never played a Dark Souls game before (including bloodborne/demon souls), you will adore this game to bits if you have the courage and determination to keep going. Some may say it's  too difficult , but then those people are usually the ones that just came from CSGO and expect everything to be handed to them.My Verdict - 9.7/10"

Such is the way of things.   Seeker of fire, conquerer of Dark. I too sought fire, once. With fire, they say, a true king can harness the curse.   One day fire will fade, and dark will become a curse. Men will be free from death, left to wander eternally.   ...And now only embers remain  We go thought countless of ancient kingdoms only to see the remnants. We are no longer  the chosen undead  who should link the fire. We are now the  The chosen one  to get those before us who linked the fire to return to their thrones.What happened to the first chosen undead? Did he ever find rest by linking the fire, or is he also one of the Lords of Cinder. Gwyn was the first Lord of Cinder and the one who brought this curse to us. but should we blame him? He did it by fear, to protect his beloved kingdom. He clinged to what he hold dear but what he did not realize is that all he did was spreading a terrible curse. Gwyn links the First flame because he trembled at the Dark, he clung to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans, and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them, Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature. By sacrificing himself to link the fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans so that the Age of Fire may be perpetuated. Gwyn did this only after all other options had been exhausted, after the Witch of Izalith failed to recreate a new First Flame using her soul. Gwyn made what we call the first sin, and the first chosen undead took his place by either relinking the fire or letting it fade. In a future we get the first look of Drangleic. A kingdom made great by a great king, but remnants of the past seeks their return. The Iron king who got the Old king soul, which connects to Gwyn's soul. The Rotten which connects to Gravelord Neto. The Chaos trying to rise again from the depths. And Queens which are remnants of the Father of the Abyss. The story once again repeats itself, but not with the king sacrificing himself. instead he runs from his purpose, and when you arrive, nothing but a hollow is walking around. Now we are in Lothric the Curse is back and we meet many broken souls. This journey is quite the trip down the memories. We found Mushroom people, thus dead but still to be found. we find old characters that reminds us of those we seeked to help but lost non the less. The black knights of Gwyn still wander around without purpose, forever cursed. One Battle took my feelings by storm though. The battle with the abyss walker. a broken yet willing to fight man. when i fought this man he fought like he was a remnant of knight Artorias. The wolf covenant is a remnant of Sif in my mind. Even a stray demon can be found and it's soul made to Havel's ring. Even though my journey is not fully ended, i will try to find all those small objects that brings us back to where it all started. With the first four souls. Good bye then. Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go Hollow."

The framerate, regardless of rig/settings is inconsistent at best, and more akin to seconds per frame at best. Having tested it on low and high end rigs, I can confirm it is most certainly NOT a hardware fault. Yet another example of a botched PC port. Fix it From. This game would be awesome were it not so graphically wishy-washy. And I paid good money for it too."

Theyâve nearly perfected their formula and it shows.Tight/precise combat mechanics/controls, amazing music/soundtrack, gorgeous art direction, massive layered/labyrinthine levels, and well-designed bosses/enemies:  everything is [kind of] the same but with more polish and detail. Difficulty is still on the fair/challenging side and even Souls veterans will feel its sharp teeth dig in from time to time (this game has the best intro boss in all Souls games that sets the game's tone for vets and newbies alike).For fans of the Souls games, this is a must-buy. For those who haven't played a Souls game and is looking for a change of pace from your standard hack-and-slash-with-QTE-heavy-sequences RPG, this is a good place to start. Highly recommended, I'm giving it a 9/10.Good job, skeleton FromSoftware. "

        "Comments": "Posted: April 30, 2016              Dark Souls 3 is a sendoff for the series. Not only have From Software confirmed that the series is going on a break, but while playing itâs clear that this is the end of the series as we know it. The game constantly references the games that came before it, borrowing visuals from Demonâs Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, and Bloodborne. The greatest complaint you can level against Dark Souls 3 is that it doesnât convey a strong image of its own, as itâs making you think of other games all the time. But as a sendoff for this series of games, thatâs perfectly appropriate. I didnât mind this approach at all, because the quality of execution is From Software at their best.This is probably the most consistently good Souls game yet. For example, in Dark Souls 2 and Bloodborne I felt the quality of boss fights was too uneven, and in Dark Souls 1 some areas of the game felt rushed. In this game though, the minimum level of quality is very high, and the boss fights are better than ever. It presents the sort of challenge I like, where you have to learn to read enemy animations to learn when to dodge or attack. Given that even normal enemies now have more animations than before, regular fights outside of bosses retain a high level of tension and excitement, even after youâve spent a few hours in the same area. Leveling up can only take you so far, so youâre pretty much forced to patiently learn enemy attack patterns to win consistently. Itâs nicely balanced, where it feels fair. Most games like Witcher 3 can often mess up subtle details in how combat works, and add a sense of chaotic sloppiness. Iâm talking about things like hit detection, invincibility frames while dodging, how target lock-on works, and so on. The best games make these things predictable and dependable, where your losses feel like your own mistake, and not the system screwing you over. Dark Souls 3 is such a game, where you CAN master it, and it will treat your fairly. As much as people (and Namco) hype the difficulty, itâs really only about on the level of Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry on medium. Itâs not a cakewalk, but most people should be able to get through this without going nuts. I mean I had more difficulty getting through Uncharted 3 than I did this.When it comes to story, the game is as obtuse as ever at conveying information, as you really have to dig into it to learn anything. Especially at the start of the game you feel starved of information, to an extent you donât in other games. So itâs more of a slow burn where pieces eventually start falling into place. One disappointment is how there are things that donât pay off properly in the story. There are things put into the game seemingly because they thought they were cool, and not because the game âis aboutâ those things. So thereâs a sense that the game couldâve been even better, had there been more depth to the story here. But I guess weâll have to settle for it being merely good.Even though the game reuses a lot of assets from earlier From Software titles, it does so with good direction and intent. The world design and layout makes sense, unlike Dark Souls 2 which was more like an amusement park than a world. There you went into a windmill, traveled up an elevator behind a throne room, and ended up at the entrance of a lava mountain land. A mountain which by the way wasnât visible behind the windmill itself. It was a complete mess. Because Dark Souls 3 only came out a year after Bloodborne, I didnât dare set my expectations too high, and as a result it consistently exceeded them. This is the kind of Dark Souls sequel youâd hope for after the first game, as it has most of the qualities that made the first game so good. One thing that bugged me is how every location has fixed time of day and weather effects. Every location is tuned for a particular look and mood. This would normally be fine. But because you can teleport everywhere in the world via bonfires, itâs a bit odd to go from a sinister solar eclipse in one place, to a moon lit night in a different location, in the span of just a single load screen. Iâm hoping this is something they can improve in future titles with better technology, so that the entire world can change its appearance as you advance through the story.As the final Dark Souls game, this is a great way to end. This is just the amount of game this formula can take before running itself into the ground. Same goes for the tech theyâre using, which also feels like its played out its role. For every flaw in the game, there were a hundred more things I thought were just awesome. I had a great time, it didnât feel its length, and I couldnât be happier with how it ended."

I'm sure people experienced these things but give it a shot, its really new, its not that surprising it has a few bugs. Highly recommended"

I'm having a hard time deciding if I recommend it or not.Yes I do recommend it to players who love to be killed over and over again, while trying again and again to improve just enough to overcome the game.But I guess I'm too much of a casual to do that for more than 3 hours straight. While I don't like the word casual, since you can't argue about taste, I have to use it in this case because while playing I noticed that IF I was into trying harder and harder the game surely isn't unbeatable. But the journey to the point where you're not having that much trouble anymore is long and unrewarding and in the end stressful.After some time ingame I was craving for a rewarding feel and a sense of accomplishment which this game just doesn't offer to a casual.BUT, and thats the reason while I still recommend it, all of the above is a matter of taste, and the developer just can't be blamed for my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥aste when it comes to Dark Souls. Objectively this game is a masterpiece of an RPG and while I had some issues getting used to the hitboxing it's also technically well done.And the biggest reason why I still recommend it is the fact that I haven't uninstalled it, even after giving up, even I, the casual that wasn't able to learn quick enough, still feels the urge to some day try again and be less of aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥then."

And holy god mother â¥â¥â¥â¥in damn am I glad I played this. It's one of my favorite RPG games of all time. But that first playthrough was so god damn memorable, granted some friends did help me persevere and get through some parts (I played it wrong, sorry.) But I went to NG+, something that is very unusual for me, since usually I play a game once, put it down and don't playthrough it again, NG+ has never really interested me before. Until this game came into my life. Sure the NG+ isn't as in depth as DS1 and 2, but I still enjoyed it. This isn't a game, it's an experience. Before this I was a casual and played on easy mode, but this game inspired me to go for hard, or very hard. Anyways, then I went to NG++ on my knight. Holy hell, I don't think I'll ever remember a playthrough more in my life, NG++ was so awesome, fighting all of the bosses, but this time purely solo. In my first 3 playthroughs of this game I ended up putting in 195 hours, and 91 of those were my first playthrough, which is the longest first playthrough I've ever had for a game. So after that I created a few other characters, and I now have a SL1 run character that I have yet to finish. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game. I myself bought it about a month ago from this day (December 10, 2017), and I bought all the DLC, you won't regret it, trust me.TL;DR summary: +Great RPG, one of the best out there+Story+Lore+coop/pvp+gameplay+challenge+getting my moneys worth and more+loosing my casual gamer status+characters+10/10 DLC+solves a lot of mysteries regarding lore+feels like DS1 sometimes!-connection (sometimes, those people with the absolute worst internet)-NG+ has been done better in previous games of the series-black bars on some monitors (my old monitor, a 1440x900p monitor had a black bar at the top and bottom, but my current monitor, a 1920x1080p doesn't have that for some reason.)-lack of build variety-sorcery took such a massive nerf, rip sorcery/magic/faith builds-at times feels like re-hashed DS1TL;DRx2 summary:Big Sword swish swoosh, good game, go buy now."

Now anytime I hit a guy it crashes. Makes me sad.If you're on PC I would wait until a few more fixes are released to avoid the frustration and a bitter taste to the start of your game.I'm running Win 7 64bit, with an AMD 64 FX Black Edition, Radeon 7800, 12gb ram"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 25, 2016              A big improvement over the first two games, in every aspect. There isn't a whole lot that has changed as far as gameplay goes; more like its been refined. Weapon arts add identity to weapon types and keeps boss weapons from being  a straight sword, but you used a boss soul on it and it looks cool . Level design goes down a linear path (ala Demon's Souls), but every level feels large with many secrets and shortcuts. Some of the fan-service is a bit silly and feels out of place, but ultimately it does not spoil what is a competent game that, FOR ONCE, does not feel like it was rushed out of development. However, instead of praising this game to hell and back, I'm going to go over the few things that are bad with the game. For one, the difficulty spikes in this game are peculiar. There are two or three areas where the difficulty suddenly shoots up, and you are dealing with enemies that seem to defy how the game was designed up until that point. These enemies are hyper-aggressive, and hit HARD which is so odd because the Souls game prior had consistent difficult. It feels like you are dealing with mini-boss type enemies at the time, but this is only really a problem if you get hit.Bonfire placement is absurd. Beat a boss, get a bonfire, then a short walk and there goes another bonfire. What? The worst offender is an area early in the game, that has about eight or nine bonfires, with 3 being within walking distance of each other. This harms level design to some extent.Music feels over-orchestrated at times. They are not bad, and the composers did a great job at creating these pieces, but nothing felt particularly memorable. It all feels rather samey, with nothing particularly sticking out because it all tries to be grandiose.Ontop of that, there are all sorts of changes to multiplayer that are baffling. Way of Blue and Blue Sentinels return, but function the exact same way they did in 2 (sans the ring). Blades of the Darkmoon also returns, but without a Blue Eye Orb, and they also share function with the Blue Sentinels. Multiplayer rewards for covenants outside of Warriors of Sunlight or also difficult to obtain at times after a certain level, despite the game implementing a level-scaling based co-op and PvP function via a password (this could work normally in PvP just fine, especially for these invasion based covenants). Most of these problems can be fixed with a patch, thankfully. Despite these strange changes, the game is still very fun to play and can only get better... assuming From Software patches the issues."

That might change with the DLC, since it is probably going to be the best content in the game, as it was for Dark 1, Dark 2, and Bloodborne.And maybe would have been for Demon's if Demon's had had DLC.Hell of a game though, and it did made me feel out of my element, like when I first started playing Demon's Souls."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 3, 2017              Updated review for sake of not sounding like a rookie. This is without a doubt the most refined  Souls game (Bloodborne isn't a Souls game, so we won't be considering it the most refined) Definitely easier for new players to get into, and a bit more linear while still allowing us enough space to get lost from time to time.Combat is easier to understand, and a lot harder to master. But there is a point at which you become so strong you can just  brute force  your way through most fights. PvP, as usual (except for in Dark souls 2) is optional, but you can't co-op without dealing with invaders. which brings me to playing with friends. Easier than people make it out to be, and lots of fun. Set up a spot for all your summon signs to be in and get to it.After playing through the game several times, I can say that NG+ and anything above is for those who feel they've gotten too good at the game. As you get deeper into the +'s you'll find enemies you used to see as worthless almost or always killing you. Invaders are also less frequent the higher level you get, but don't be surprised if someone invades you, since a lot of high level players just walk around with a red eye orb on to see if anyones out there.  The DLC is a must if you're a Souls fan, some of the best bosses to date in the DLC. Worth every penny. I do recommend it fully.I wouldn't consider myself an expert, but i've developed my character around support and defense (heals and heavy shield) and i'm able to multi-roll since i've got points in every stat. if you're in need of help feel free to get in contact with me and i'll help out if i'm able to.Edit of the edit: NG+ 8 and 9 are not fun, you've been warned."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 18, 2016              The game is simply amazing.Best gameplay of the three entries.Best atmosphere of the three entries.Best soundtrack of the three entries.Best bosses of the three entries.Best weapons of all the three entries. (lotsa of comebacks as well)Coolest looking armor of all the three entries.Best summoning system (for jolly-fellas) to partake in all the three entries.That being said. The game ain't perfect. For instance, I'd really like to see a couple of things:-> More NPC interaction at Firelink Shrine. It would be much appreciated if they reacted more to the things the Unkindled One does. It takes too long for them to even bat an eye at the things you do.-> More NPC dialogs. For they repeat themselves way too much in this game, to the point of them sounding douchey or even seem that they've got Alzheimer.(I know the game has some bugs regarding NPCs, accidental triggers of appearances and whatnot, but that's minor imo).-> Maybe some ''Gestures'' could trigger specific reactions from monsters/NPCs (not only the Firekeeper, thanks Bloodborne for that one). I lost count of how many times I used ''Call Over'' to try to lure out enemies.-> Ice/Frost based Miracles/Sorceries. I We need them. (Maybe in future DLCs?)-> Darkmoon Blades / Blue Sentinels still suffer a great deal when leveling their covenant. Invaders have it way easier, as usual. In addition, it seems that the Blue Eye Orb no longer exists... I hope they bring it back.-> A graphical enhancement would be nice as well. The game looks gorgeous, but up close, you start to see its flaws and low texture, which are plentiful.Edit:-> NG+ Could be more similar to what they did on Dark Souls 2, the way it is right now could use some improvement (different enemies and perhaps different placement and so on)."

I think everyone should at least try out a game in the series once. I do recommend you start with dark souls 1 however, as the original feels a bit clunky after playing through the whole series. They are all amazing and among my favorite games ever. The setting and atmosphere is excellent, it's very dark and the world feels intimidating. The difficulty is really good, as the games are difficult, but it is not artificial (like just more dmg or hp or more enemies).I really recommend it, along with the dlcs (which are also excellent).On dlcs: - Ashes of Ariandel is a bit short, but with the best boss fight in the series at the end.- Ringed city is long and really good. The areas are brutal, but as the final DLC in the final game, I had hoped the bosses would be a bit harder."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 7, 2018              Dark Souls 3 is an incredible game and a true hardcore masterpiece. It is a perfect example of inderect storytelling, with a rich and haunting game world, expert voice acting and a beautiful soundtrack to accompany you while you journey through this dark, dieing world. The controls are smooth as silk, and the weapon arts add many new strategies and ways to combat the terrible foes you face. Of the Souls games I have played (not including BloodBorne) I would have to say thatthis one is technically the smoothest, with very helpful features like homeward bones having extra options and many other things. Multiplayer is amazing, and once you get the hang of how the elaborate system works, many awesome experiences await you (except for point down). The game also has amazing replayability and alternate endings to achieve, as well as NPC story lines which all intertwine and that can change how the story will go. Overall, I would recommend this game to Souls fans, lovers of a challenge, and newcomers alike who want to experience the hauntingly beautiful, decaying world of Lothric."

Hell yesIs it game of the year material? Hell noOverall rating: 8/10"

It's a game completely comfortable with its' own new ideas and the ones that came before it. PVP is still active and likely the best of the series. A fitting end to the Dark Souls saga... so when's Bloodborne 2?"

Nostalgia-vision too strong.Dark Souls 2 is a bunch of weeaboos, tryhards, OnlyAfro wannabes, and brazilians. Poise too strong.Dark Souls 3 is a bunch of edge, anime, OnlyAfro wannabes, russians, and broken weapons. Poise is dead.In all honesty though, I did enjoy this game, from start to finish. Initially, I was having crashes constantly, due to my pc being garbage, but as I've upgraded, I've found the game to run at a consistent 60 fps with dips only being occasional. Onto Pros and Cons.Pros:-The game is gorgeous, coming onto the same (or a similar) engine that Bloodborne used.-The areas are well designed and don't always feel the same. (Save for Irithyll.)-There are plenty of weapons.-Poise being dead makes fashionsouls viable again.-Yuria.Cons:-The story's vague and hidden in item descriptions.-Some bosses are just garbage levels of hard for no reason.-Weapons that are in the meta don't go patched for ages.-Dual ultra greatswords.-Not enough reason to use magic.Overall, I personally love the game, but you know, it's subjective. Some people hate it. Some people hate Dark Souls 2. Some people hate Dark Souls 1. Some people just hate Dark Souls. I just hate edgy edgelords."

If you have played the previous ones I believe you will find this one easier and maybe like me feel that the world is not as big or deep as in the previous ones. On the other hand if you have not played any of the series before, you will definetly consider this a brutally hard, huge and very deep game.All in all it is a great game, much like the previous ones with a lot of replayability. I had a few issues getting it to play well on my decrepid old pc but with some tweaking of the settings I was able to enjoy it all the way, wiht only a fewmonr hicups here and there (with the exception of the last dlc where my frame rate - until the first boss - was so low that it crawled).If you are a fan of the series, you cant miss it... regardless if it is better or worse than the others, it is Dark Souls....If you havent played the rest I would strongly encourage you to start from the first one."

(Well, boss)But as time progresses, as you push further into the story itself, the beat gradually intensifies with each boss you fell, until you find yourself lost amongst the games intricate level design, the heart-pounding OST, and the interesting cast of NPCs you can meet.In no way is this a perfect game.None of the Souls are really, they all have their flaws, yet they remain heavily enjoyable due to their unique style.I would even go so far as to say this game even surpasses Dark Souls 1, 1 which has reigned unchallenged for many a year now.I heavily recommend this to others, but mainly I would recommend this to people who have experienced 1. 3 borrows heavily from it, and I highly recommend either playing 1, or researching the lore before beginning 3.You will be all the richer for it, I assure you."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 19, 2017              Dark Souls 3 is a pretty decent single player game.The enemies are varied, the boss fights are engaging, the level design is great. I prefer Dark Souls 1 level design in particular, however, because teleporting was not an option until much later in the game; it made you feel like you were truly exploring the world, and everything was connected. Comparatively, you are now required to teleport to get to the first actual level in this game, and to subsequent levels. Teleporting was very seldom a requirement in Dark Souls 1.The way multiplayer/PVP is balanced is horrid.Sure, co-op with friends is good. Just as it always has been in the Souls series, when you look at the co-op aspect by itself. However there is a major problem. Now more than ever in this game series, invaders are urged to twink (at lower levels). Here's why: 99% of the time, invaders are matched with players who already have co-op phantoms in their world. Yes, the invading system favors hosts who already have their buddies with them, ready to gank your invadingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥back to your world. Coupled with the covenant system where blue defenders can show up and gank you even harder, it's no wonder why invaders twink. They have to twink in order to win. And when these twink players invade a player and his friend who are playing normally, with no upgraded equipment and early-game gear, they become casualities to this idiotic system.When it comes to PVP at higher levels... Well, let's just say it's not fun. Since there is no poise as we're used to from DS1 (and to a lesser extent 2), and since shields are pretty useless except for a very small percentage, PVP is a roll-fest. Have full Havel's on? Prepare to get stunned by bare fists. You wanna use a shield below a greatshield? You better be ready to become a parry king through guesswork, or get shield broken and take repost damage. By the way, when it comes to armor, heavy and light are now not viable. The only truly optimal armor to wear is medium. It provides the best amount of defense in the game for the least amount of weight. Miyazaki got the title wrong, this should have been named Bloodborne 2.I say that because it's a game completely focused on dodging. You are encouraged to dodge, and that idea is exemplified by the fact that you basically have fast rolls until 70% weight ratio. Rolling is simply absurdly over powered and is essentially a core gameplay aspect. Regarding shields, all but greatshields are useless. All parry options now have a windup before the actual parrying window starts, and combined with the fact that attacks from enemies are much faster than in DS1, it's much harder to parry on reaction, if not impossible.Overall,I'd say if you want to play the newest Dark Souls game simply for the sake of it being a part of the Souls' series, do it. But if you're going to be playing, be prepared for what I have described."

        "Comments": "Posted: November 22, 2018              This is another great game in atruly great series. If you have played the previous ones I believe you will find this one easier and maybe like me feel that the world is not as big or deep as in the previous ones. On the other hand if you have not played any of the series before, you will definetly consider this a brutally hard, huge and very deep game.All in all it is a great game, much like the previous ones with a lot of replayability. I had a few issues getting it to play well on my decrepid old pc but with some tweaking of the settings I was able to enjoy it all the way, wiht only a fewmonr hicups here and there (with the exception of the last dlc where my frame rate - until the first boss - was so low that it crawled).If you are a fan of the series, you cant miss it... regardless if it is better or worse than the others, it is Dark Souls....If you havent played the rest I would strongly encourage you to start from the first one."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 1, 2016              Dark Souls 3: Prepare to Lag Edition, the PvP is atrocious. consistently taking damage from swings that completely miss my character or don't even come close. PvE is pretty good if you like Dark Souls games, but the PvP needs some serious work. Wouldn't reccomend for a PvP oriented player. If this game fixes its lag issues in PvP, its easily a 8/10 for me, but for right now its more like 3/10. The PvP is insanely fun when i finally get a non laggy duel, but thats about 1/20 duels... That being said i am still enjoying the PvP in this game, its just really annoying that i so rarely get a decent matchup and typically have to fight a dark sword that hits me 2x out of the sword's graphical representation, but when i finally do get a good match, its a great time."

This is genuinely one of the best RPGs I have ever played.If you're like me though and haven't played any of the other games, then be warned that you will not understand a lot of things and you will have to look many things up on the internet. So many references and areas are so awesome to most people, but not to me, and I'm just incredibly confused at everything that's going on.It is still a damn fun game though, and that's why it gets my recommendation."

        "Comments": "Posted: October 6, 2016              Dark Souls III is an engaging, somber and atmospheric, intense combat driven experience.At its core it is a 3D Action RPG with limited hand holding by design.Gameplay Summary:You control a character from a 3rd person perspectiveThere are 3 core stats: HP, FP, & Stamina Running, attacking, blocking, & casting spells uses StaminaStamina naturally regenerates at a rate based on your attributesUsing skills and special abilities reduces FPIf you run out of HP you dieKill enemies to gain SoulsSpend Souls on gear, items, weapon upgrades/augments, and stats for your characterWhen you die you lose the souls you have collected and leave behind a vaporous verdant glow which when interacted with retrieves your Souls which you had at the time of deathOnly one death vapor can exist for any given player at any timeAll players can invade to kill and also come to aid in their and your worldGameplay Details:This is the most linear Souls game so far, but also the most accessible to new players- taking roughly 8 hours straight to complete the first time for someone comfortable with the combat system.The story is somewhat of an extension of the previous titles. You'll find a lot of references to all of the previous Souls games in the details.Compared to the previous titles in the series- Dark Souls III is much of the same thing with some refinements, cuts, and additions.Rough terrain, ambushes lying in wait, overwhelming groups of enemies, and death pits. Dark Souls III challenges players not to die, over and over again. This game can be as intensely frustrating as it is rewarding. The standard sword arts have been refined drastically and  power stance  dual wielding of weapons is no longer available to players. Weapons have abilities which can be activated for an amount of FP which have various effects, such as a special attack or temporary increase to a stat/attribute among other modifiers.There are checkpoints scattered around the game worlds various zones which you can teleport between much like in the previous titles. They appear much more often in this release of Dark Souls, than in previous titles, making the overall difficulty somewhat paltry. NG+ and onward is a sad increase in difficulty by merely increasing the amount of health enemies have and an increase in damage dealt.The major improvements to the core gameplay of the Souls series are especially apparent in the boss fights, they've been improved from the previous Souls titles by leaps and bounds with transitions that drastically change the bosses attack patterns requiring players to change up their approach from aggressive to defensive and vice versa on the fly.Sound design leaves nothing to be desired at all.The soundtrack and the atmosphere are absolutely perfect.Dark Souls III runs excellent on all last gen video cards and it looks beautiful though it is fairly CPU demanding in order to run above 30fps consistently.Online play can be frustrating due to the connections being Peer to Peer. The worse a players internet connection is the more likely there will be desyncs which will cause all kinds of issues and drastically alter interactions between other players as well as players interactions with other players world's enemies."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 30, 2016              This is everything Dark Souls 2 should have been.Still not as good as the original Dark Souls, mainly because the gameworld is not completely interconnected like it was in DS1, it is more linear, but the levels themselves have become much larger and more intricate. Save your estus because if you waste it you'll be left looking for a bonfire like it was an oasis in the middle of the desert.Also... poise. Poise should apparently be there in the game, somewhere, because a lot of items and skills give a poise bonus, not to mention armor. But it just doesn't work. I'm not going in-depth because there are countless threads and videos about this... what matters is FromSoftware's statement about this, saying it is  working as intended . I don't know how to feel about this but it's clear they â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up on this one, somehow...Still, overall this is the worthy sequel to the original Dark Souls, finally, after DS2 and its  expansion  left a bitter aftertaste. DS2 in comparison looks like an indie fan-made game, and its lore sounds like straight up fanfiction.  Well, what is it  DS2 fanboys? u mad? fite me"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 18, 2016              Everything I wanted from a soulsgame or another bloodborne + more. Some people said this game would be linear but that is pure bs. The game is full of optional paths and open areas and imo has some of the best level design fromsoft has ever done. The thing I wanna talk about in ds3 the most though is how amazing it is to have the proper boss design back, something I loved about the first dark souls was how every boss is a new and surprising challenge, going from the giant lardass asylum demon which you have to try and run around, Taurus demon which you have to bait and drop on / roll through between its legs, gargoyles and then a gigantic â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dragon mouth beast. In ds2 I was so disappointed with 99% of bosses following one of 2 formulas;1. A two legged central character with a  1point  hitbox, that used pivoting attacks which you were forced to always roll through rather than avoid or walk around like you could in the other souls games (Pursuer, dragon rider, Vendrick, glass knight, flexile sentry, dragonslayer, the rotten, smelter demon, Velstadt and Najka.or2. just a bunch of copy pasted  multiple enemy  garbage meme boss types, like the rats, gargoyles, sentinels, skeleton lords, double dragon riders, magus and congregation.There are exceptions to this, like the slightly interesting demon of song or the ancient dragons, but the rest of those exceptions are pretty widely considered as garbage bosses, and dont even try to tell me you thought Old Iron king or the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Sif rat were good. DLC has one or two bosses that might be decent although I think theyre pretty overrated, but either way the gank squad, smelter demon v2, cat and cat v2 drag it down.Therefore its such a huge relief to see that every boss I've played in ds3 so far has been something new and diffrenet much like in ds1, just with even bigger and more amazing surprises, mechanics and designs that seperate them from the rest. The only problem with the bosses is that they have very small health pools, making it easy just to walk up to the boss and start hacking away, tanking many of their attacks since you wont run out of healing and making it pointless to spend time to trying to figure your way around its unique and complex moveset and develop new strategies. This was the case for me even though I avoided upgrading my weapon as much as possible and put almost all levels into vitality and endurance.Bloodborne's DLC bosses were amazing fun when they had a giant health pool and would take around 40-50 tries to complete, and I imagine many of Ds3's bosses are also a lot fun when you are weaker, since they also seem to have unique and interesting movesets.So yeah, this game is amazing, and I recommend not upgrading your weapon until you deem it completely nescessary. And do not do bosses in coop, just dont. It takes away so much of the satisfaction and fun in doing them. If the bosses in ds3 wereâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and you wanted to finish them in as few tries as possible I could understand mimaxing / coop, but luckily theyre not, and they are definitely worth spending some time on, :)"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 28, 2016              Dark III is complete garbage and I do not even plan on finishing the game any time soon. And here is why:1. POISE - Every Enemie in the game has poise. Some have more, some have less and some you can even stagger if you roll against them. This is totally fine and is indeed a good mechanic, there is just minor oversight to it that ruins the whole gameplay. You have none. No matter what the game tells you and tries to make you believe poise would be a thing for player characters, it is not. You get staggerd by every minor hit and get comboed to death.2. COMBOS - Enemies have attack patterns and when you learn them you eventually  git gud  at this game. There is again just one minor problem. Seemingly endless combos. I have counted and came across quiet a few enemies who did quiet fair damage and were able to perform a combo of 6! This is ridiculous. You do not even have to be caught in one of those it is just the fact that enemies seem to have endless stamina when it comes to attacks, just as they would not use any of their stamina to perform them. Still you can cause a guardbreak to them through attacking their shields (if they have any).3. SHIELDS - They are not good for blocking anything, because of above mentioned endless combos. If you are not good at parrying or plan on becoming so, or do not plan on using a greatshild, do not bother to throw them all away.4. PARRYING - I seriously do not know what is wrong with this mechanic in DARK III, but it feels very broken. I often get partial parries and take all the penalties of that (partial health and higher stamina loss), but still parry the enemie and can perform a counterattack. And this ca. 50% of my parries. the rest are actual parries or I miss them. Maybe I am just off, but then again, why get a partial and the parry at the same time?5. ARMOR - Armor is worthless. It makes nearly no difference in regards of defense nor in poise (due to its abscence). the only serious difference is if you wear armor, or not. It just does not matter which kind, how heavy, how much poise or how much defense it says it gives to you. Thus, making the stats of any armor almost useless, it all breaks down to fashion souls. take what you like and do not give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about defenses.6. ENEMIES - Well, there are enemies, that are quiet difficult to defeat, but only if you are not dealing high enough poise damage to them, or get staggerd because you have no poise. There are no  special  enemies, just annoying ones that are hard to defeat because of their artificial difficulty. For example, there is a enemie type that drains your health in an enormous tempo, just by looking at you. And they not only take the health out of your healthbar, they take the whole goddamn thing. So there is no chance for you to heal and keep going. You HAVE TO wait for your healthbar to return, until you can continue fighting or you WILL die if you are not fast enough. This mechanic is sick and shows us where Dark Souls has come to - complete garbage -.7. BOSS ENEMIES - Nothing much to say about them. They are not necessarily uninspired, but very plain. No real intense fights with them, nor any big challenges. If one is hard to defeat, call a summon and get done. You will not miss any spectacular bossfight.8. COVENANTS - You can change your covenant at any given time, due to the fact that there are now items that symbolize the bond to your covenant. There are no real good rewards and as far as known, only two covenant tiers for every covenant. One tier for turning in ten and a second for turning in 30 covenant items at the shrine, or leader. The only real interesting covenant is the one (not saying any names here, because of spoilers) where you can decide to be a good or a bad phantom. Absolutely dumb is also the mechanic, that you now get the item related to your actual covenant, if you invade as a red phantom and kill the host. This is just a poor excuse for not giving you any, specialy valuable and strictly strained reward for ranking up in the individual covenants.9. NPCs - They have at least questlines. Some are quiet interesting to pursue and some are not. But I did not experience any major twists.10. Weapons - Mostly copy pasted from previous Dark games. Just a few exceptions and not really worth mentioning here.11. Magic - Never used and never plan to do so. Until now it seems to be pretty useless.12. PVP - Quick weapons outplay almost everything, because you can be staggered by everything and ganking is still what people love the most. In the end I do not recommend this game to anyone. Atleast not for that much money. If you want to take part in the Dark series, stick with DS I, still by fare the best of the series, sadly. I do not speak english as my native language so do not hate on that."

I love the series. but they sold a hyped game.-- The Graphics are amazing, really like it..-- The combat system changed. New combos, weapon art. Is just loveable.. new game.. new mechanics.-- Bandai did a really bad move.. sending review copies to few streamers 30 days before the official release date. to hype even more. No respect for those who even pre-order the game.-- The game is not working proprely, many bugs, HACKERS, lag switchers. Developers don't care about it on pc version. since the game was made for consoles that have no way to hacker until this moment. i said HACKERS alredy? Oh yeah be sure you will encouter a lot. From Soft is not doing anything to control the Hacker rampart.-- Options that is builded in game dont work at like Cross-Region Matchmaking, even when Cross-Region Matchmaking OFF you still playing with chinese, australians and etc... It means they are going to lag.. or just killing you teleporting arround.  Option totaly usuless or maybe developers have no geographic classes. The game insist make me play vs chinese, korean and other countrys really far away.-- Game is totaly out of balance on pvp. Is to easy for the host keep rolling and sumoning infinite. Since the invader only have 7 estus vs total 21(Host can keep sumoning every phantom have 7 estus) is totaly unfair. the game should be fun for everyone, even for invaders. since the chance to sucess a invasion is less than 20%. ( i have 1600 pale tongues - 1000+ blue tongues on my 2 chracters  ((before you people say i'm crying about it.. just deal with that.. i'm probrably better than you)) -- Theres only 10 weapons in game worth to be used, most everything is really garbage. The current meta is arround a Hornet ring that increase 30% of your critical damage or you one shot people or you lose..-- The Game Lore is the poorest of the series. The game is absolutely easy. too many bonfires. Just not worth to keep replaying it..-- The Level designer is too linear. It changed from the previous Souls games.. so you always going to play the same linear path.. it makes the game even more borring.------ At the current moment i don't recomend to buy the game, even high end rigs have bad time with the gameMake sure next time from release a game.. to remember what they done here..."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 11, 2016              This is a beautiful game.  The artwork is superb, the fighting mechanics are nearly perfect, and the story is fascinating if you take the time to search out the clues.  The game is quite hard, but oh so satisfying when you progress through it.  However, the community of PVPers are for the most part horribly rude, there are issues of rampant cheating on the PC version of this game, and there is really no viable way to avoid the endless invasions by cheaters and non-cheaters alike if you want to play this game with a friend.  And that is the point, if you want the PVE coop experience do NOT buy this game.  I bought this game for myself and a couple of friends so we could play together. I played it offline (which is obviously solo) and loved it.  I  played online by myself and the invasion frequency was  tolerable and I actually had fun at times.  However, when I played coop, it was one invasion after another; it took forever just to advance the story.  Now if you want to play PVP go for it; the PVP is actually excellent.  If you want to play solo offline go for it, like I stated earlier, the game is beautiful and satisfying.  But, if you want to play coop with friends for the PVE experience it will just suck plain and simple.  I will not recommend this game because FROM software has an elitist attitude about this game and punishes coop PVE players.  Recently they just patched the game to make invasions occur even more frequently so now in coop all you will be doing is playing PVP; frankly, it sucks.  I am sure I will get alot of hate for this review, and the hate is strong from the Dark Souls 3 PVP crowd, but I believe the issue must be stated.  Thanks for taking the time to read this if you did.  Have a great day."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 12, 2016              I just got the game so I don't have too much time into it yet, but I do want to express something important.  First, I love the Dark Souls games.  I feel they surpass most games in sheer artistic value and atmosphere and their ability to draw you into the game and make you care for it.   The art design guys should all get medals and baubles and goodly things.   I specifically wanted to give a not recommended vote here as a gesture and demonstration, because I think for an established franchise like this, that makes very good money, it's sheer laziness and unacceptable to refuse to make a decent PC port, with 2016 frame rates, and not forcing me to find a mod somewhere and use some crazy key binding so I can do some basic moves like jump attack or kick with my keyboard and mouse.  It's not like you haven't seen the comments EVERYWHERE since dark souls 1, come on, don't be cheap, don't be lazy, make it right.  Be a stand up game developer guy; say hey, we sell a lot of these games on Steam for the PC, so let's do it right, yes many play games with controllers even on the PC, but many don't, so let's give people an actual choice.  If some kid somewhere can make a mod to make this work, so can you.  Or better yet, pay the guy some money and buy his programming wizardry from him and put it in your game if you can't figure it out.   Now here's what I mean by lazy... the game recognizes I'm playing with a keyboard, because that's what I have in my settings.  So I'm walking around through the intro, where they have signs on the ground that tell you what buttons do what... and it's press triangle, press left bumper , press O, seriously?  It's that hard to change the message so it matches the actual device the game knows I'm using so it can give me the correct keys?  Heck I can do that for you and the only programming I took was some Basic and Pascal in College.  Give me 10 hours and a box of Twinkies and a connection to the net and I guarantee I can  fix that for you.  In conclusion, great game, and I WILL love it.  It's successful, and it deserves to be.  But be a standup developer guy, take a bit of that money, and make the game right for ALL the devices.  Thank you.  But yes, people should still buy it."

Allso most of the time when me and my friends try to get help or want to help then the servers use to much time to send us help or send us to the person that needs help. Allso, that anyone can at any time just invade your game when you only want to run around and experiance the game with some help and have some fun.Mob/NPC glitches: I've come across, normal mobs, bigger mobs, small bosses and big bosses that respawns instantly as soon as you kill them. There is a bug in the programming that is so bad that I want my cash back for this game.Buttons: Locking people is very hard, unless your character actually is turned the correct way and is looking at them you cannot lock them, but the npcs for example can shoot you with spells and arrows fromt he other side of the damn map, while yourself has to move within 3 meters of them to be able to target them.And the jumping? Which idiot remapped the keys in such a horrible way that people who actually could do DS2 without leveling cant even get a single item because they have to use forever to find out how to jump in a game."

Enjoyable until softban for using a controller emulator (X360CE) that literally makes the game playable.  Will update review if FROM adresses the community regarding banning players for playying the game normally.EDIT: 5/11/16To random people that see this review and find my word untrustworthy. I highly suggest browsing the net and looking for yourself, Bandai Namco/FROM literally state online in multiple outlets that they consider any code injection a breach of EULA and therfore bannable. Specifically including controller emulation. Thus the only recourse is to buy a 60 dollar xbox controller rather than use the controllers that most budget gamers already have. To reiterate, FROM / BN are BANNING people from the online elements (read  a huge portion ) of the game for using off brand controllers with a controller emulator rather than an overpriced games for windows controller. They KNOW that thats all that said people have done (upon examining their accounts supposedly) and they just state to said people that  no one has ever been un-banned once banned .Thatsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥customer service on top of shoddy programming, and I for one view that as an insult. If i could refund thisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥i would. Instead, i muck through in solo play. Till they deside to ban me from that too for using a ps3 controller knock off."

And no, not that icy thing in the beginning, that guy with the sword in his heart.Supposedly this is going to get harder from here on out and the messages on the ground are not helping, because Youtube has told me to never trust them anyways.On a serious note: The controls take getting used to. It's not like in most RPGs or Hack & Slays where you can cancel animations with a dodge roll. Further, it doesn't really help the case that the game is trimmed to only display the control schematics of an Xbox controller. Why can I even bind the keys to my mouse and keyboard if the game can't reflect that when it is trying to tell me which buttons to press to do which move? Took me a solid 3 minutes to figure out how to jump because in the settings it just says  Space  but in those messages it tells me to press RB while pressing LB or someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I also wasted a firebomb trying to put it into my equipment. lol.The game doesn't explain a lot of things like:What does it mean when I have defeated the boss of the level and my entire armor is glowing? Is that some sort of buff or just an indicator that I have defeated that boss?What can I do with the souls I have collected?I'm sure those questions wouldn't even come to mind if I had played DS1 or 2, but tbh, understanding game mechanics and systems (like collecting souls) shouldn't depend on whether you have played the previous games or not. No issue with not understanding all of the lore, but not mechanics and whatnot. Maybe the game will tell me later.Aaaaanyyways, seems like a fun game so far. I'm not a masochist but having a game that offers some real challenges and unforgiving gameplay is quite a refreshing thing to see. Almost all games just double the hitpoints of enemies and reduce the players damage in order to raise the difficulty and that's just frustrating and annoying as hell.Last but not least, the art style of this game is pretty great so far. Love it."

Storywise you will miss some things, but the gameplay and overall feeling is the best throughout all Souls-games. DS2 might be a bit complicated and overwhelming for newcomers, and DS1 is just too old and not as well ported from console, compared to DS3.List of Pros for upcoming Wanna-be-Ashen-Ones:Easy-to-learn Controls (even for me, who really struggles(-ed) with controllers, since DS1 was my first game of that kind)Very immersive (the overall mood is a bit dark, which fits my taste. Even though the NPCs don't have any dialogue options available, they feel very real and you can relate to them, and your character. Also music and sounds are beautifully woven into the mood of each map!)Challangeing and unforgiving gameplay (Don't belive everything the internet tells you:  DARK SOULS ARE THE HARDEST GAMES EVER!!!!!!1111  It is challenging, yes. It can be frustrating, yes. But nonetheless it never felt like undoable at any point. You don't need superfast reactions. All you do need is a good memory for boss attack patterns and until you figured all of them out, it can take a while. Sure good reactions can help you for a good portion of the game, but they are not THAT important overall. By that I mean, its not that important WHEN to dodge, its more like HAVING to dodge at some point during a specific attack. So I would state, the PvE part of the game is less about skill, then it is actually about patience/time investment.)In addition to the previous point I mentioned, I want to state that there is nonetheless  ALOT of room for skill in this game. (So if you like becomeing better and better over time and love having the feeling that there is still room for improvement, this is the game for you! You can perfect certain machnics, which sure make the game easier, without really needing them to beat a particular boss. See the negative section below for even more details!)Graphics: awesome for a game originally intended for console.Huge variaty of mobs/bosses and maps. (every boss feels unique in mechanics, aswell as in skin. Same goes for enemies, there are just a few you can find on every/most/multiple maps)(in my opinion/point of view) there is a unique Online-play/PvP System. (Which is a nice perk! You can have some epic PvP matches during PvEing, because there is an invasion system, which allows other players to come into your world and hunt you down. It might be frustrating at the beginning, but once you know the basic game mechanics it becomes more and more fun. Also the designers implemented thoughtfully a pretty nice support for new players (Blue Sentinels/Way of the Blue), so it's not too overwhelming for them and getting owned 24/7.)Very little bugs/glitches, I would even say none at all. (That I know of)Regular updates, which balance weapons and monsters. Also there will be DLCs, which are in my experience (from DS1&2) really worth to buy, since they offer alot of endgame content and unique bosses/storylines.No grinds. (You really don't have to grind at any point of the game, it's just not worth the effort. You can still do it, though, if you are the kind of person who likes grinding. There are some things you don't need for game progress, but are somehow worth the time)And only to round up the picture, I want to give some  negative  input aswell:About mechanics/skill that makes the game easier: I would've wished for some bosses to force you to use a specfic mechanic (like parrieing) or even build variation (only vulnerable by magic, for example). Even though every boss has it's own weaknesses against specfic damage-type, it feels like it does not actually matter which element you choose from.Do not expect a Skyrim-like RPG-adventure! (It's not like those kind of RPGs at all! There are way less quests/NPCs and a way smaller and more linear world to explore. To find every item in the game you can have in one single palythrough, took me roughly 60 Hours, for new players this time should be ~150 without any help and 100 with guides from web, I suppose.Also you character is much less costumizable (Still with a huge variation in builds, but without different background-stories or in-depth skilltrees).This is not really a fair point, since Dark Souls does not want to be a Skyrim at all, but I wanted to mention it anyway, since I found some people complaining about that! Some people might find this actually more positive, thats one reason why I used quotation marks on the word negative abovely,SO MANY TRIES. (As I said in the positive section, if you are not a natural, expect to die -alot-. Which is not really your lack of skill, I can assure you. It's more like you don't know the attack patterns, yet. Even me, who knew DS1 and DS2, struggeled with some foes so hard, I died at elast 20 times to them (try killing a fire demon with a pyromancer...). Also you will find yourself without any heals left and a pounding heart, not knowing the path to choose to the next checkpoint! Exihlerating, but discouraging, if you die over and over.)In my honest opinion there has to be a lot of work to be done in terms of netcode for PvP online play. (While PvE-Coop-play mostly works great, I experienced alot of lag, rubberbanding and random hits in PvP. To be honest, I suck at PvP, but thats mainly due to the fact, I suck at parrieing, which is because my LT-Key does not work properly. But I know the (PvE-) game mechanics well enough, to know when I shouldn't be hittable, and (in PvP) I still get hit during dodgerolls frequently. Or in other cases I get hit by a Shortsword (little range, on paper) while being out of range, and therefore missing the target with my Ultra Greatsword (huge range, on paper).That's the reason I usally avoid PvP. Of my overall 150 hours played, I engaged maybe 20% in active PvPing. I know there are palyers which PvP ALOT more, but thats my experience, so far.)You will sometimes feel  lost . (Either it's the storyline, which at some points just doesn't tell you where to go next. Or the lack of any quest log or descriptions. It actually fuels the imersiveness of the game, but at some point you just feel cheated by the game for not telling or just hinting you where to go/what to do next.)The maps could be a little less linear. (Well that says it all, doesn't it?)I wrote down more negative points, than positive ones. But as you read them, you will notice some of then can count as both, according to your own preference/likings.I have to split my review here, since I am running out of characters... Next Part (in the comment section of this review) will be for people, who know (parts of) the Souls-Series."

        "Comments": "Posted: December 25, 2017              After only 1.5 hours and around 15 deaths I killed the first boss enemy. And no, not that icy thing in the beginning, that guy with the sword in his heart.Supposedly this is going to get harder from here on out and the messages on the ground are not helping, because Youtube has told me to never trust them anyways.On a serious note: The controls take getting used to. It's not like in most RPGs or Hack & Slays where you can cancel animations with a dodge roll. Further, it doesn't really help the case that the game is trimmed to only display the control schematics of an Xbox controller. Why can I even bind the keys to my mouse and keyboard if the game can't reflect that when it is trying to tell me which buttons to press to do which move? Took me a solid 3 minutes to figure out how to jump because in the settings it just says  Space  but in those messages it tells me to press RB while pressing LB or someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I also wasted a firebomb trying to put it into my equipment. lol.The game doesn't explain a lot of things like:What does it mean when I have defeated the boss of the level and my entire armor is glowing? Is that some sort of buff or just an indicator that I have defeated that boss?What can I do with the souls I have collected?I'm sure those questions wouldn't even come to mind if I had played DS1 or 2, but tbh, understanding game mechanics and systems (like collecting souls) shouldn't depend on whether you have played the previous games or not. No issue with not understanding all of the lore, but not mechanics and whatnot. Maybe the game will tell me later.Aaaaanyyways, seems like a fun game so far. I'm not a masochist but having a game that offers some real challenges and unforgiving gameplay is quite a refreshing thing to see. Almost all games just double the hitpoints of enemies and reduce the players damage in order to raise the difficulty and that's just frustrating and annoying as hell.Last but not least, the art style of this game is pretty great so far. Love it."

They just could tell me  30% price-off will expire in one week  or anything, but they don't, they did nothing, I just feel been ignored.I hope a bad review will remind NBGI it's a terribe marketing."

If you like PVP, it is endlessly replayable, and the  story  is deep and vague enough to keep you interested for a long time. At this point, it's pretty cheap when it's on sale.

Nope, not even close. Ran it on my trusty old piece of junk 2009 desktop.Despite my average 20 FPS I still have enjoyed the game a lot. From does it again, everyone!I loved every single moment of it (excluding the crashes before the 1.03.1 patch came out, of course). The amazement of finding and exploring new areas (and being completely taken away by the pretty scenery), the excitement of boss fights (some of them REALLY badass, mind you), the tension of the combat, and of course the jolly cooperation, which I have indulged into very often (because pvp sucks).I'd say the only  bad  thing the game has is just the usual signs of From Software Quality Programming (the heck is with all these Scaleform threads using up an entire core?), but despite all that it's a great game, and I can say for sure it surpasses its predecessors.I definitely recommend it, that's for sure."

I hope they can make up for it in the future DLCs. It's a really fun game, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel quite as replayable as the other souls games. The story itself is really well made, the combat is really fun, there are many amazing weapons, and overall the game looks and plays amazingly.I just wish that the game didn't feel as if fromsoft wanted souls gone as fast as possible."

If you like PVP, it is endlessly replayable, and the  story  is deep and vague enough to keep you interested for a long time. At this point, it's pretty cheap when it's on sale. I can't imagine regretting this game as a purchase. It's a no brainer."

Nope, not even close. Ran it on my trusty old piece of junk 2009 desktop.Despite my average 20 FPS I still have enjoyed the game a lot. From does it again, everyone!I loved every single moment of it (excluding the crashes before the 1.03.1 patch came out, of course). The amazement of finding and exploring new areas (and being completely taken away by the pretty scenery), the excitement of boss fights (some of them REALLY badass, mind you), the tension of the combat, and of course the jolly cooperation, which I have indulged into very often (because pvp sucks).I'd say the only  bad  thing the game has is just the usual signs of From Software Quality Programming (the heck is with all these Scaleform threads using up an entire core?), but despite all that it's a great game, and I can say for sure it surpasses its predecessors.I definitely recommend it, that's for sure."

Whether you're new to the series or a returning vet, you're gonna absolutely love this entry in the Dark Souls series. This one has more roots with 1, more so than 2. Combat is fast paced, enemies offer a decent challenge even if you've played the previous games in the series. I found this one to be a bit more difficult than 2. If you played 1, then you should recognize the references, and returning characters that make appearences. Small spoiler, the final boss will really hit the long time players right in the feels. Overall this game looks, and plays great, and remains a very challenging game for newbies or vets. If you haven't played the Souls series yet... Then what the heck are you waiting for? DIVE IN AND PLAY"

Hacker check. this game is overpopulated with hackers and the developers really aren't doing much to resolve it. Don't misunderstand me, not everyone you come across will be a hacker. Some players are really good and have spent hours perfecting their playstyle and then there are hackers. I've encountered some hackers that just don't care and outlandishly cheat in a way that is absolutely ridiculous, and then there's the dirtbags who cheat and try to pass themselves off as good. seasond players know what I mean but let me explain. Some hackers are so cheap that they alter their stats to have things like extra defeinse or attack. some individuals will do unlimited stamina, my all time favorite is preventing death. That's right, taking so much damage then preventing their health from reaching 0. So it's only natural for players to get banned after being reported that way the rest of the player base doesn't have to suffer.I wish it were true, but that same hacker that invaded your game two days ago is still invading in the same area and crashing your game, and sending them into an infinite death loop. Without video proof of the hacker in action, it takes a massive amount of reports before steam will look into it, and even than theirs no guarantee that the hacker will get vac banned. so either get gud at alt F4 or deal with it.Ok, maybe not deal with it. again the game is great! I spend hours it and every time I learn something new and find a different way to kill other players without the use of hacks or cheats, but hackers kill the game. Fear not because DS3 is on multiple consoles and on consoles, they perma band hackers, and cheaters.  So buy at your own risk it is your money, and if you think its worth hours spent dealing with hackers and cheaters then fire away or avoid pvp and being emberd which kills part of the game its self."

        "Comments": "Posted: June 9, 2016              Alright, now that I've slogged through the game, I feel safe making a final judgement.While I have a lot of good about to say about Dark Souls 3's visual style and atmosphere, the game is severely hampered by poor optimization, nonexistant weapon balancing, completely useless heavy armor, and a truckload of bugs.The main issue stems from the gameplay. You, as the player, are slower than molasses, yet nearly every enemy in the game is lightning-fast and comes in packs. This leads to a LOT of cheap deaths, unlike in previous titles where you were punished only for making bad choices. I can't bring myself to recommend a game that punishes you for playing the way it was intended.PvP is in a completely broken state. Poise, as many know, has been cut down to a near-nonfunctional state, encouraging the usage of weapons that can stun-lock an opponent into submission. This turns PvP encounters into something more closely resembling an Old West-style High Noon duel, where whoever draws first wins, rather than a test of your skill against another individual.Final recommendation: If you're a hardcore Souls masochist, I'd still recommend you wait until the game goes on sale. If you're someone who wants to get into the Souls series, go play Dark Souls 1 or 2 instead. Anyone else, don't bother.Also, if you're going to comment, please actually contribute something constructive.  Git guds  and the like will be deleted. I won't delete your message if you disagree with me, but your argument should actually be more substantial than a childish insult."

Otherwise not so much.There's zero innovation. Zones are okay, but nothing exceptional to the older games, and some zones are just an annoyance. Bosses are roughly the same, you could like fighting them, but ultimatly you just learn their movesets and easilly dispatch of them eventually. The boss aldritch came close to being interesting, but was the same thing in the end. Balance is complete trash. Poison does 3 damage a tick, damage is all over the place, using gems on weapons sometimes has no effect or nerfs the weapon. PVP is trash again with no innovation on previous titles, and covenants managed to be the worst in the series. Weapons like greatswords have lower dps than alternatives, expose yourself more, and don't even have the best crit profiles. You can evade a greatsword user for five minutes in pvp just getting in their face and dodge rolling if you watch out for kicks and not take a single hit.If you want a themepark to kill some time in give it a go, but don't expect to be blown away."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 14, 2016              DISCLAIMER: If you intend on playing this game offline, I recommend it completely, apart from the performance issues and occasional crashes. Now, onto the meat of this 'review':Do you enjoy invading and having a fair chance against 3+ people?Do you enjoy partaking in balanced, skill-based PvP combat?Do you enjoy being able to invade gankers and solo hosts an equal amount?Buy Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin. You'll find none of the above in Dark Souls III. It's sad to say, but it's true.The game prioritizes hosts with phantoms when you invade. But not JUST hosts with phantoms, mind you; the more phantoms they have, the more likely they are to get invaded. I have done well over 300 invasions across a few different characters, both in early and late-game areas. I have invaded a grand total of two people that didn't have phantoms with them.Now, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if FromSoft didn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ up so many other parts of the online.You see, to be invaded, you need to use an ember. This gives you roughly ~30% extra health, meaning anyone invading you will be at a disadvantage in max health too. However, phantoms also only get half the health-restoring items that the host does.. both white/gold phantoms and reds/purples.So not only do red phantoms have to deal with hosts with 30% more health, but they have to deal with hosts with double their estus, and white/gold phantoms with equal numbers of estus uses to themself. Absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ridiculous, but that's not even the worst of it.The game uses a basic two-hit system, like Dark Souls II. Players have no poise, meaning a dagger will stagger a person in full Smough's just as effectively as it would stagger someone wearing nothing. Combine this two-hit system with the fact that there's no working poise for players, and you get.. gankers stunlocking invaders to death with no chance to roll out of it.I believe that Dark Souls II got the PvP absolutely perfect. You invaded solo hosts as much as you invaded gankers. The host could heal when you invaded them, but you and white/gold phantoms couldn't.. apart from miracles that took ages to cast. The advantage that gankers had over invaders was numbers, and even that was a massive advantage if the co-op players weren't braindead idiots.To conclude this, I guess I'll sum up my thoughts on the game: Dark Souls III is a fantastic game (and entry into the franchise) with deep lore and fun, challenging combat. However, the online has been hindered severely due to FromSoft casualizing it. You're free to say that they 'balanced' it, even though gankers and co-op players already had an advantage in Dark Souls II. However, you'd be completely and totally wrong. FromSoft wants to get more people into the game, and they care more about the 3 friends who buy the game to ezmode the game in co-op together than they care about the Souls veteran who buys the game for fair and enjoyable PvP. They make more money that way.I hate to say it, but this game's community has grown far more immature and childish with this release. If FromSoft realizes how badly they've screwed over invaders and balances invasions, I will change this review to positive.And don't even get me started on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Estoc and Dark Sword.EDIT: After one year, the Estoc and Dark Sword have been nerfed into being worthless. The PvP still sucks.EDIT2: After two years, there's some nice DLC added. PvP is still garbage."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 1, 2016              This game hurts. Not in the way that previous souls titles do. This game hurts in that it's not the game it should have been. There are technically various ways to approach it, but you can no longer play a real tank character, magic is effectively useless, as it requires you to be completely invested in magic stats and using a very specific set of items and equipment. Pyromancy and Miracles have the same exact issue. I recently reinstalled because I had heard there would be DLC, and I'm hoping the DLC will add in balance changes that fx how awful the PvP is. I've fought maybe 6 people since reinstalling, all of them R1 spamming goons. The two hit stunlock limitation simply made it so that they hit you twice, roll out, roll in, hit you twice again, rinse and repeat. This game lost what made souls pvp fun. Creativity is no longer viable in PvP. It's barely viable in PvE. The game feels unfinished, and the director himself has apologized for it. The armor system is almost entirely pointless, after running some tests I found that the difference between a starting armor set and a late game heavy set was literally 14 points of damage. Honestly, lore wise it doesnt make all that much sense or add a tremendous amount on the series. It's very pretty though. All in all I would not recommend it. Just replay the lightning strike of genius that is the first Dark Souls."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 20, 2016              I have mixed feelings about Dark Souls 3. On one hand, it's not obviously bad in some places like Dark Souls 2, but on the other I don't know what this game is trying to be. It has elements from all 4 Soulsborne games that don't go well together. It's definately an enjoyable game, if you're into the Souls series, but also disappointing in some ways. Let's start out with the positive side of Dark Souls 3:+The game looks gorgeous, no question about that. Probably the best looking Souls game on PC to date. +The world is huge and well connected. Not quite as well connected as DS1, but you can see other areas from your current area (like seeing the Bell tower from Sen's Fortress) and there are no weird Earthen Peak -> Iron Keep situation. +It is easier than every to play with friends with the new password system (although I've seen people say it doesn't work)Now let's talk about what I don't like in Dark Souls 3:-My main problem with the game is the change of pace. Enemies are a LOT more agressive this time around, with seemingly infinite stamina and long combos. It gets particularly bad mid to late game when enemies get a ridiculous damage and health boost. The game essentially punishes you hard if you do anything other than roll and mash attack. Tanking is pretty much pointless (you can't even upgrade armor) and magic users are at a serious disadvantage compared to previous games since their casting speed is so slow and scaling is so messed up early to mid game that you'll be spending more time swinging a sword than casting Soul Arrow. I heard scaling gets better around 50 INT/FTH but I don't care enough to get to that point. -There is a LOT of reused content in this from all previous Souls games. I don't want to spoil it, but there are more recycled characters than new ones. Same could be said about the armor and weapon sets. There is an area that is LITERALLY ripped straight from Dark Souls 1. I know the official explanation is some time distortionâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ but really it's just lazy pandering. I can bash Dark Souls 2 all day, but at least it had more original content than this-Covenants are kind of half baked. People have been reporting that some don't even work properly. -This is the THIRD game on PC that still has â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Xbox prompts. Why is no one complaining about this? Some people actually play with a keyboard and it's not even that much effort. Modders have been doing it since DS1. Maybe I'm just tired of the Souls formula at this point, but at it's current state Dark Souls 3 is not as fun to play as Dark Souls 1. It's certainly better than Dark Souls 2 but that's not really saying much. I would advise you to wait for the inevitable GOTY edition which will hopefully fix the gameplay issues I have with the game. As it stands it's an okay game, with some really glaring issues."

The story, combat system and the epicness of bossfights is just awesome. Yes, the game is hard and yes, you will see the  YOU DIED  screen quite often but this makes the game so challenging, cool and motivates you even more to kill the boss that kicked yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥so often now! Also there are many very cool sidequests and secrets and I'm in NG++ now and still haven't found them all! :)You've probably read other reviews that don't recommend the game because of the hacking and banning stuff but I ask you to please ignore those people. Yea, I know, PvP is really cool and stuff but until they fix the problems, just don't play online.There will be time for PvP when the problem is fixed and the whole Co-Op thing is lame in my opinion, because killing a boss with three guys steals the game the challenge.Thanks for reading, I'll go play some Dark Souls now :P"

        "Comments": "Posted: July 19, 2017              Have you gotten gud yet? Dark Souls is a throwback to the days of Dark Souls 1 and guarantees to make you feel nostalgic in so many ways. Its a step up from the second game in the Souls franchise and functions as a perfect apology. As Bloodborne was released before Dark Souls 3, it seems the speed of Bloodborne has latched itself onto Dark Souls 3. Many souls fanboys were very skeptic upon discovery of the fact but, I suppose, they don't like a challenge, eh? Dark Souls is a series about pushing through the unknown, pressing forward with your shield raised, probing the darkness, and looking for the flicker of the next bonfire. When the fire is lit, the previous area loses its mystique. It is conquered. This same sense of familiarity permeates Dark Souls 3, and it only ever gets you out of your comfort zone by resorting to cheap tricks. Yet despite this, itâs still a beautifully bleak adventure with one of the best combat systems in videogames - it just falls short of the magic of the original. Like the opening cutscene says: the fire fades.Dark Souls 3 really is amazing, the game mechanics have been polished to the point of perfection regardless of the lacking magic system (feelsbadman). As someone who grew up with Demon Souls and partially Dark Souls 1 it warms my heart to see the spark has returned. Dark Souls 2 was a let down on so many levels that it seemed the spark was gone. But I guarantee you, although this isn't Dark Souls 1 or Demon Souls, this is a Souls game to the core. The level designs are beautiful along with the designs of the boss arenas and the bosses. The NPCs and the regular enemies. It is all just beautiful. I know there's been discussions in many Dark Souls communities whether the difficulty of the levels and bosses are suitable. I think, however, the difficulty doesn't matter. Some thoughts of mine, after Dark Souls 2, were that the franchise would soon meet its end, and I think  Dark Souls 3 is the grandiose end to an unmatched trilogy.  And I think that what Miyazaki has done is provide us with one heck of a closure, I think FromSoft put less time and effort in the difficulty and more in the graphical and auditorial parts of the game (as much as the parts that made one nostalgic)."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 27, 2016              Amazing game so far. Loved Dark Souls, but found Dark Souls 2 quite hard to get into. Dark Souls 3 feels a lot more like true Dark Souls sequel than DS2 did, to me.Visually there has been a major upgrade. The game looks great. Same awesome creature/boss design. The base game seems pretty big. I'll definitely grab the season pass at some point though. One of the only games where I feel like the season pass is worth getting.It's been a long time since I played a game where I found myself looking forward to the next time I would get to play it (probably Dark Souls). It feels good to have a game that is worthy of my time. The Dark Souls series may be challenging, but it never feels like a chore to play through, which the majority of games I have played in recent times have felt like. Most of them have also felt like a waste of money as I lost interest in them before I got my moneys worth. Definitely getting my moneys worth out of Dark Souls 3.Whether you are new to the series, or a veteran player, I'd highly recommend this game.Only negative thing I can say about it is that I am experiencing a persistent stuttering issue (I have a i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3 1600 RAM and a GTX970 4GB. The game is also running off of an SSD). It doesn't really effect the gameplay too much, but it isn't exactly ideal, either.I am not sure if it is network related, or possibly sound related, or will be addressed with new graphics drivers. I recall a similar issue with Dirt 3 that was resolved by installing some 3D audio software. Might hunt that down and try it as a fix.Anyway. Yes. Amazing game so far. Love it!"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 26, 2016              Marketing has always been a problem for the Souls series. I remember being supremely disappointed in Demon's Souls, a game lauded back in 2009 as this new, revolutionary RPG experience with innovative multiplayer features. I played it, died a bunch, killed the first boss - a thoroughly unimpressive black blob - and thought:  Is this it? . The game seemed to be lacking almost all aspects I consider critical to a good RPG, such as story, player choice and an immersive world. Best foot forward this was not.Nevertheless, the Souls series marched onwards, becoming a worldwide multiplatform phenomenon. Marketing shifted its focus to emphasize the extreme difficulty.  Prepare to Die! , barked the banners and billboards in anticipation of Dark Souls 1. I still didn't see the appeal. From the outside looking in, it seemed like the game was merely difficult for the sake of being difficult. Plus the PC port was initially abysmal.In retrospect, it's a crying shame that the true strengths of the series were so rarely mentioned in any materials: The all-encompassing sense of discovery, wonderfully glum Dark Fantasy atmosphere and the scale & feel of a grand adventure. I propose that only by letting go of your preconceptions can you start truly enjoying the Dark Souls experience - a reason why  blind  playthroughs are a big thing among DS fans. Now that I've finally completed my first Souls game, I realize it's all about the journey, not the destination.Not knowing what lies ahead creates a powerful framework of both tension and awe. The game delivers on its rich environmental details: Emerging topside after a grueling jaunt in some underground ruins is always rewarded with a new, spectacular vista - a promise of more discoveries to come. Treading lightly is also rewarded, since you need to be acutely aware about the fact that the game is just waiting for you to drop your guard for a second to plunge a knife in your back.Observation and determination are required in equal amounts. Dark Souls 3 is definitely a difficult game, but eventually overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds can result in rare  MMO Raid Boss  -style highs that are seldomly reached in single-player games. The combat system is cruel but rewarding - Probably my favorite close-quarters brawling system in any game.I only wish the game did a better job of explaining its underlying mechanics. I absolutely enjoy exploring totally foreign, sprawling areas and meticulously studying enemy attack patterns, but some crucial under-the-hood stuff is just plain not communicated well or at all. It took me ages to figure out you actually cannot be hit during parts of your roll, or that the roll gets progressively worse even while you're below the maximum load threshold. I still can't claim to completely understand the parry system. The game just goes a bit too far with its obfuscation in places.Story is another aspect I cannot really be fully satisfied with. While Dark Souls lore is undeniably rich and you can sense the coherency in its worldbuilding, the story could use some more flesh around its bones. The intro movie seems more like a boss highlight reel than a yarn being spun into motion. I can appreciate what the lack of story is going for, but even if it's all an exercise in futility, I feel the tale could be told more effectively.Overall, after finishing Dark Souls 3 I can't help but to feel the need to kick myself for letting this series slip through the cracks. It's amazing that a game this good could be created today using design tenets mostly from the eighties, but there it is. I don't have to agree with or even like all the design decisions at play here; What I do have to recognize is the whole - A game that feels tremendously right, stubbornly clinging to its age-old ways, knowing there's still some spark left in them.I'm not sure I can say Dark Souls 3 is for everyone. I know that I initially anticipated completely wrong things from the series. But what I can say is that the less you expect from it, the more you will end up getting."

The story, combat system and the epicness of bossfights is just awesome. Yes, the game is hard and yes, you will see the  YOU DIED  screen quite often but this makes the game so challenging, cool and motivates you even more to kill the boss that kicked yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥so often now! Also there are many very cool sidequests and secrets and I'm in NG++ now and still haven't found them all! :)You've probably read other reviews that don't recommend the game because of the hacking and banning stuff but I ask you to please ignore those people. Yea, I know, PvP is really cool and stuff but until they fix the problems, just don't play online.There will be time for PvP when the problem is fixed and the whole Co-Op thing is lame in my opinion, because killing a boss with three guys steals the game the challenge.Thanks for reading, I'll go play some Dark Souls now :P"

I binged this game and finished it in a couple of days with LATE nights. The way I describe this game is as you smash your desk on the verge of quitting you still have that love of the game to pick yourself up and fight that boss one more time, and I loved every bit and this game will have a special place in my heart, I legitemetly got sad when I finished this, and the music makes you feel alot of different emotions, and definently the credit music got me man, BUY THIS GAME YOU WONT REGRET IT"

Dark souls III rises above its previous younglings, and takes all of it into one sucessful bundle of dark fantasy. If you liked 1, 2, and Bloodborne even, chances are you'll love this too. Combat is fast and fluid, graphics are, although not a killer, shines in many areas. The music will keep you motivated, as the epic haunting sounds of Yuka's score blasts through each boss. Buy it. You won't forget this journey. Don't worry, dying is a normal routine."

What is wrong tho? Barely nobody plays it now days. Those who do, are either die hard fans, hackers trying new scripts or anyone who has a connection that can only be described from the moon.cool game, would fab more.__________________________________Best souls game to date for me.Experience all the other dark souls series and i can firmly recomend this piece of art.The punishing and extrodinary rewarding experience is still there, packed with familiar aspects from the beloved dark souls 1, it is just perfect.Dark souls 3 also has the most memorable fights and encounters ever and i genuinly say it as the best among games.Plus the graphics ain't half bad, if you are looking for those kind of games. (actuality is among the most good looking)"

As you learn, it becomes more and more rewarding, but more challenging too. Give it some time, and it will make you a much more skilled gamer. Give youtube some more time, and it will reveal you one of the greatest lore stories that exist. Get it, play it, suffer it, enjoy it."

        "Comments": "Posted: December 26, 2017              I have heard a lot about Dark Souls over the years - mostly that it is one of the most challenging games out there. When it went on sale for the Winter Sale 2017, I figured I should give it a try. It's cheap and very highly rated. Dark Souls III is a no-BS kind of game. It doesn't mess around. You start a new game, make your character (I selected a warrior, being that it is the easiest class to play), and you're thrown right in. There is no hand-holding introductory level that carefully guides you into the world. You rise from the dead, and you are thrust into an unforgiving landscape of undead foes and relentless bosses. I was surprised to find that even the first boss in the game is totally unforgiving and difficult to defeat. Dark Souls has me constantly trying to find new strategies and ways to battle and every enemy feels challenging; even the grunts at times. One wrong move - one over-confident approach on an enemy - will get you killed. I must have lost to Iudex Gundyr about 15 times before I finally picked up on my mistakes and learned his moves and strategy. That victory is the most satisfying victory over a first boss I've felt in a game ever. Most first bosses are just sponges with high HP, but Iudex Gundyr is a formidable and skilled foe. The combat system is unlike any other game. You have to choose your moves carefully because once you commit to one attack, you have to stick with it. There is no cancelling a move. Dark Souls' enemies requires you to be patient and calculated. You aren't able to just rush all the enemies because even the grunts will predict what you're about to do and slash you before you can get close. The knights are significantly challenging in comparison to all the undead grunts that just rush you with a sword. They'll block with their shields until they corner you and then beat the crap out of you. Moving on to Lothric Castle, I've died countless times now, but made a little more progress each time. I've never been both so frustrated and satisfied by a game at the same time. If you are looking for a game that is interesting, beautiful, challenging and full of growth for you as a gamer, I recommend picking up Dark Souls III, even if you have never played a game like it before. Because I haven't, but I am completely sucked in. Don't let negative reviews scare you away. I find most of them are about comparing DS3 to previous Dark Souls games. If you're looking to hop into the Dark Souls universe for the first time, DS3 is a solid game on its own."

Pros:- Game world is truly stunning- The game is challenging, even the most basic enemies can slaughter you with ease if you aren't careful- Pieces of lore that tie in nicely to the previous games- Rewarding item drops - your exploration and effort is rewarded and there is a ton of unique gear through out the game world- Not completely tied in to a linear approach  (I missed an entire area and story boss that I had to go back for)- The community is respectful, upon summoning a co-op partner there is always a bow or a wave and the same when you help them complete their boss battle- FPS is solid and load times on my solid state are almost instantCons:- The  fog wall  at the Shrine. Whilst not game breaking, it's a little frustrating the area doesn't load at once- If you're interested in a PvP element and have never played a Souls game, there is no balance. You are randomly put in to another players world. I regularly have invaders come in to my world whilst I have 2 sunbros so it's immediately 3v1 (not to mention any equipment disparity)- There are a few problems around summoning phantoms, 60% will come up  timed out  or  unable to summon phantom - Server lag is pretty bad at times, though it appears to have eased in recent days (24/04/16). So, should you buy it?Absolutely, yes. I haven't had this much fun in a game since Witcher 3. It's punishing and abusive but I keep going back for more. Such is the Dark Souls relationship."

The level design itself will throw you off so often that you feel as though you're almost always lost. A single path can split into three or four different paths. The only downside I have with this game is that some deaths can feel unfair because an enemy  grabs  you instantly kills you or breaks your guard and hits you over and over until you're dead without giving you a chance to do anything about it.There were plenty of moments where my heart was racing as if I had just been running away from the cops in a high speed chase going 150 MPH.9.5/10 because it's the same old Dark Souls we know and love but made better than 1 and 2."

One of the best games Iâve ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking to get into Dark Souls or continuing their adventures in Dark Souls.This game is one of the greatest games ever made. Heck, this game is one of the top three greatest artistic achievements ever made.  The only negative is it's probably one of the easiest games ever made. Despite the easy sauce covering this game, Dark Souls 3 fills you with a feel good story, a sense of optimism, and never say quit attitude. This game is a breath of fresh air in the current era where game designers spend way to much time making hard games that frustrate gamers. The story is straight forward and simple. There is no need to guess or speculate. In fact it puts the story codex right on the items. Finally, on the rare occasion that you die, the game will let you know just in case you missed it. BS aside, this is really the game of the year from 2016. It makes Dishonored 2 seem like a joke. It makes Titanfall 2 look like a a newspaper comic strip. And even Witcher 3, DLC included, fails to compare. I recommend this game. If I could get a hold of a FUMES great sword, and somehow figure out a way to lift it, I would force you to buy it (for your own good)."

        "Comments": "Posted: February 14, 2018              I'm just going to say it. I'm a picky mother â¥â¥â¥â¥er.When I was 8 years old, I played Shadow of the colossus for the first time in my life, and for the longest time no game surpassed the experience I had with that game.No matter what game I played I would always unfairly compare it to shadow of the colossus and be dissapointed by it. A friend recommended dark souls to me so I started playing the games. I started with demon's souls, then dark souls 2, then played a bit of dark souls. But this one is the first I finished completely. And I think I found a match for SotC.The Music:Very much like SotC this game is mostly silent, and the only sounds you hear are the sounds of ambience and the sounds of swords and spells when fighting. This is really atmospheric to me since it feels as though the game knows fighting is a normal thing you'll have to do, and it doesn't treat fighting like a special event triggering a battle song or anything. It chooses to play its music in very specific moments, like boss battles or specific areas like firelink shrine. The story:This is where I find dark souls shining more than SotC. Don't get me wrong, The story of SotC is amazing, one of the best in videogames imo, but I don't like to be spoon fed information, I like finding things out on my own. Which was partly the experience I had with SotC since at the time I didn't know english so the subtitles didn't help much.But that's the beauty of Dark souls, everything is up to the player to find out if they want to. The game risks the possibility  of being called a hard game with no story since it's not given to you.YOU HAVE to find the story. You decide wether or not you go seeking for it. And that's great.The feeling:This is where this game just ARGH, WHERE IT GETS ME HARD.So, I didn't know this for the longest time, but apparently the reason why I had such fond memories of SotC was because It's just you. It's just you and no one else. No one lives in the forbidden land, you are on your own.No one gives you advice, nothing, it's just you, the mission, and the adventure. This is why I loved darksouls too. There are npcs, so you are not completely alone, but the adventure is very much lonely. You are an adventurer going through castles with monsters in em andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you want help, do it. But now that I'm on my second play through of the game, I decided to not co-op bosses, and man does it feel way more rewarding and genuine.This game made me go back. It's the first time in a long time where me and my friends share information about hidden stuff and not search it up online in a wiki. It really does feel like I'm playing my ps2 again. This is the only game that's made me feel that way in a while. Dark souls gets a lot of praise, and it deserves all of it. Just buy the damn game."

The game has a few minor problems but they haven't taken away much from the game in my experience. The net-code for online/PVP is horrific so you can expect quite a few laggy phantoms although co-op seems to work fine and the password system makes it far easier to play with friends.A worthy successor to the original."

Nothing is exactly what it seems, but the way the world has advanced from DS1 is utterly inspiring.However, the overwhelming feeling from all the endings and all the lives, and all the souls that form such cinder, is that in the end, nothing you do matters. Even if you usurp and consume, you will be naught but a hollow, and those that follow you will still live in a broken world with broken people.Life sucks and there's nothing you can do about it. But that's okay, cus everyone else is here too."

Dark Souls 3 feels a lot more like true Dark Souls sequel than DS2 did, to me.Visually there has been a major upgrade. The game looks great. Same awesome creature/boss design. The base game seems pretty big. I'll definitely grab the season pass at some point though. One of the only games where I feel like the season pass is worth getting.It's been a long time since I played a game where I found myself looking forward to the next time I would get to play it (probably Dark Souls). It feels good to have a game that is worthy of my time. The Dark Souls series may be challenging, but it never feels like a chore to play through, which the majority of games I have played in recent times have felt like. Most of them have also felt like a waste of money as I lost interest in them before I got my moneys worth. Definitely getting my moneys worth out of Dark Souls 3.Whether you are new to the series, or a veteran player, I'd highly recommend this game.Only negative thing I can say about it is that I am experiencing a persistent stuttering issue (I have a i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3 1600 RAM and a GTX970 4GB. The game is also running off of an SSD). It doesn't really effect the gameplay too much, but it isn't exactly ideal, either.I am not sure if it is network related, or possibly sound related, or will be addressed with new graphics drivers. I recall a similar issue with Dirt 3 that was resolved by installing some 3D audio software. Might hunt that down and try it as a fix.Anyway. Yes. Amazing game so far. Love it!"

If you have played the other souls games front to back, be it dark or demon souls, or bloodborne for that matter, this game is definitely for you. If you tried another souls game but found it (a little) too hard or frustrating, or you have never played a souls game before, then i suggest you skip this one for now. Play the other Souls game to end. as FromSoftware really upped their difficulty this time around, Dark Souls 3 could be an extremely frustrating experience for newer Souls players. I give it a 9.5/10."

You don't see everyone using the  Best weapon in the game  at endgame because there simply isn't any  best weapon in the game  its all about what looks and feels good. If you want to push through different areas and beat monsters up and get a massive dopamine rush when you finally beat the a**hole that kept murdering you, then this is what you are looking for."

        "Comments": "Posted: August 22, 2017              Dark souls 3 review: (Reedited) AH Dark souls 3 what an epic finale to the soulâs series.It's a fantastic and unique game that draws you in if you let it. A little determination to get past the difficulties and a little patience are needed. But it's so addictive you will not want to stop playing. The games perfectly balance action and RPG. There is no guide in the story line. You get thrown right in, with no maps, no hints (some minor one) you have the to figure out everything on your own.You might think that lore is simple, but you are wrong. Well the lore is just hidden and you need to have patience with the dialogue and environment to take all pieces into one, and that final piece is how you understand the story. And that works brilliant. The variety of weapon is great, and the combat systems works well. It may not be as good as Dark souls 1, but in general I think that is better (not in lore). I will end this review by saying that this game IS NOT for everyone. ItÂ´s difficult and you will die a lot, btw âgit gudâ ð there is a lot of items and secrets that u donât discover on your first playthrough. And mentioned earlier, patience and focus is the key to play Dark souls. the soundtrack is one of the greatest I have listened to in a video-game, and DLC content is always interesting and enjoyable. So give it try. Thank you for reading my review, I know that my English isnÂ´t on top (grammar misspelling etc.) My personal score: (9,5/10)(Btw, FYI I have completed this game on ps4 before I did on my pc, so thatâs explains, why it only took me 11 hours to complete ) :)If this was helpful, feel free to add me so we can play PvP against each other ð Have an awesome day"

Absolutely gorgeous graphics and artwork. Backgrounds are a joy to see. Consistent and fluid combat system, be it PvE or PvP. Bosses fights are amazing and the AI is very well designed Best soundtrack on the series, which fuses perfectly with their respective bosses. Old Estus flask, which in my opinion is better than the horribly implented lifegem from DS2. Whole new sets of armor, rings and weapons with balanced stats. Spectacular story with multiple endings (be advised that you have to had played DS1 and DS2 to fully understand it). Lots of secondary storylines from NPCs, each one having it's own touch. Multiple classes to choose, differentiating from each other, unlike DS1. Infinite replayability. Cons  Getting a different ending requires either a walktrough, or a good amount of luck. Poise has yet to be balanced. Few bosses have an attack pattern literally impossible to avoid or block. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing catacombs. Unfair anti-cheat system. after the mess with innocent people getting soft-banned for unwillingly fighting cheaters, I hope they fixed it.In conclusion I think they fused the best of DS1 and DS2 with some new features and the result is an almost perfectly balanced and amazing game.Rate: 9.5/10"

When I first played it I sucked (as expected) but as I played further and made better choices (DONT USE MAGIC) I became a lot better and after over 100 hours in the game I finally managed to beat the game (Look I gave up my first playthrough before I beat it I was close though.) If you are thinking of picking up this game I completely recommend this just yeah."

I don't have the time to go over all the great gameplay elements that this game offers amongst stunning environments and new areas, but I do have time to explain this:Dark Souls II should just be Dark Souls: Scholar of the First Sin, storywise it really is just an 'alternate universe'Dark Souls III spiritually is the true successor to Dark Souls."

I died 8 or 9 times to the tutorial boss, but the next day, I defeated it. This game made it difficult to put down, and I found myself swinging away and enjoying every boss fight (except curse-rotting greatwood). A few hours later, and I have started a new character, one whose play style I enjoy every bit as much as the original character. The game has a steep learning curve, and it is one of the best games I have played."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 22, 2016              This review is my opinion of dark souls 3 written after killing every boss and finishing my first playthrough. Warning: long review, non-native English speaker, mostly praise. While dark souls 1 is my favorite game of all time, dark souls 3 can easily be my top 4 games of all time alone, despite my love towards the franchise. Itâs sad to see that dark souls 3 is the last game for its series, but I look forward to play its DLC and more awesome games made by From software.Boss fights: there are about 20 bosses in total in dark souls 3. All of them are not easy and require a lot of death to figure out the right strategies.  The satisfying feeling that I get after mastering the mechanic after countless death and finally beating the bosses is what makes these fights great.  Every boss fight has its unique theme, music, and they all have different phrases when the bosses become more powerful. About half of the boss fights are designed really well that are really memorable. Several boss fights have reached the level of epicness that I have never experienced in any other games. Theme/graphic/music: the world of dark souls 3 is dark and beautiful. The world is full of details: different designs for the thrones of lords that match their lore, cells that are full of decayed bodies but still tell stories of their prisoners through furniture and items, areas leading to bosses and boss rooms that amplified the power of different bossesâ¦ The world is as pretty as some other games like the witcher 3 and farcry, but the music is better in my opinion. The music for different areas and boss fights are so in tone with the game that makes me even want to go back to fight the bosses again after so many death and finally beating them. Bosses may be strong, but they are not as strong as the tones created by the piano and violin in those music. Interconnected world: dark souls 1 has most of its worlds interconnected to each other. This level of world design has never been reached by another game for so many years after the game came out. While dark souls 3 has not reached the same level, it is obvious throughout the game that the developer tried to make maps interconnected. As a result, there are a lot of shortcuts that connect different sections of the same area or different areas that would not normally connect to each other. Finding those shortcuts enriches the experience of exploring the world.Weapons/armors: while weapons and armors are similar to DS1 &2, 2 important changes are made. 1. Each weapon now has a special attack that used mana to cast. This makes weapons more unique, and it would have greater impact on PVP than PVE. 2. Weapons can be upgraded, but armors and shields can no longer be leveled up. This greatly reduces the defense of mid-late game characters. Leveling up defense items and tank a lot of hits is no long an options in DS3. This change makes mid-late game PVE more challenging, and it can create a lot of build varieties in PVP. I think people call this the return of the fashion soul. Lore: while the witch 3 has the best lore and storytelling among all the games, souls game focus on actions, and DS3 chooses the right approach to tell its story. The game doesnât tell its story directly. The player needs to learn about the story through hints around the world. Itâs easy to miss the details of the story if not paying attention to item descriptions and connecting the dots between dialogs of NPCs. To me, this is the prefect approach: the action of the game is good enough, and if the player wants to learn more about the lore, it is free to do so, and there are plenty to learn. The story of dark souls is simple yet complicated, and dark souls 3 finally completes the cycle of the whole story. The faiths of god, fire, humanity, and undead are all depend on the choice of the player.Return of the old elements from pervious souls games: several areas of the game and characters have returned from pervious souls games to dark souls 3. This is truly amazing for a souls fan.   Combat/difficulty: combat is faster than pervious souls games and more punishing. Weaker defense and spells make it hard to tank a lot of hits or stay in safe distance to spam magic. Again, dark souls focus on actions, and there is simply no better games in the market so far in term of action/movement of the character. While I wishes some bosses have more HP and leave less open windows for the player to attack, the hard ones are hard enough. The first boss(tutorial boss) is actually challenging for me: a not-so-noob player, and it really showcases the principle of this game: dodging and timing. Dying a lot and losing all the hard earned souls is mandatary, but that is how a soul game should be played. Co-op: while I didnât choose to co-op for any of my game progression, co-op and invade are easy and fun. I did tried some PVP, and it seems there are very few pure casters since spells are much weaker in DS3 comparing to DS1 and 2. People use spells mostly for buffs. In short, dark souls 3 worth its full price, and itâs definitely one of the best games Iâve ever played. I tried to explore the world as much as I can during my first playthrough, and Iâm sad it âonlyâ last for around 60 hours. It was such a good time for every single minute I spent on this game. Iâd definitely suggest anyone to play this game. Also, try to play the game with minimum guides/coop for progression during the first playthrough. It will make the experience much better."

        "Comments": "Posted: May 13, 2016              This review comes from a offline playthrough, as I prefer a single player experience like with every game I play. But especially with heavy mooded games like the Souls series I prefer to be completely immersed without being distracted by online traffic. Also this is just my first playthrough, so I'm probably missing a million things. Having said that I can say the following about my experience:+ Graphically this game is sublime, absolutely beautiful. Textures are rich and detailed, background and lighting are very atmospheric. Very happy to see as much beautiful medieval fantasy architecture (both interior and exterior) as there is. + Not only that, it also runs very smoothly (at least on my system) and I have encounterd little to no bugs on my 80+ hours of play.+ Combat is satisfying and fluent. There are some great movesets, it's pretty hard to choose a bad weapon here (as long as your build is suitable for it ofcourse). + Some boss desings are awesome as ever (not all quite as surprising as in DS1, but some really are)+ I like the collection of characters you get to meet and the story they carry with them. There are a couple of really enjoyable storylines to follow throughout the game, making it a very replayable (NG+) experience.+ The number of weapons, armor and other loot is also very impressive+ The way leveling works took a little bit time to get used to, but in the end I liked it, it's fun to play around and see what works best for you. + Good variety of characters and playstyles to choose from+ Locations feel fun and varied, although some may not like the reusage of former game locations and formerly valuable key items being (at least seemingly, I might be missing something) casually thrown in a dusty corner and reduced to mere non-essential decorative trinkets. I think the rehash has been done in a nice and respectable way, but then again I never played Bloodborne or DS2 and only the first part of Demon Souls so I probably recognised less and interprated more elements as something new. - I don't like the idea of Fire Link as a central hub. It has its advantages, but it very much makes the world feel less naturally connected. What I absolutely love about DS1 is the way the levels connect with eachother and the freedom of movement you've got to navigate between them both back and forth. Every place you see is reachable, you can walk right to it (except for the asylum at the beginning, but that was a deliberate and thought out decision, it makes sense). Here from the very start you can't reach Lothric without poofing from one bonfire to another. And you need to poof back to get back to Firelink Shrine, no walking allowed. To me this makes it a destination without a solid, touchable place in the game world, even though you can look upon it from afar from certain points of view. - Also in general there are way too many bonfires too close to each other, reducing the challenge and breaking immersion\\sense of urgency in exchange for more focus on combat and faster pacing. They might as well have made a quicksave option at this point.- Many of the characters in this hub seem to have too little variation in the lines they say as you progress in the game. Especially the Fire Keeper which whom you have to talk to most because you can't just level up at a bonfire anymore. There are some surprising lines and lore to discover, but I think there could have been more (hell, there isn't even a why-did-you-ran-away-without-saying-bye line this time around). I know for sure I have missed some by the decisions I've made in this playthrough, so I hope to discover more on next playthroughs. - I haven't found a use for the repairing system yet. My armor never wore off and neither did my weapons. I must be missing something here, or at least I hope I am. All and all DS3 is a great experience and I would highly recommend it. To me it's not as fresh and original as DS1, but that doesn't mean it's not an awesome, challenging and satisfying game. When all the hype has been done hyping and maybe the cheating system will be fixed I'll go for a online run, but it's already been fun enough."

The environments are all varied and gorgeous, the combat feels amazing and the new weapon art system adds a new layer of depth. The game is difficult. Of course that is subjective, but in my experience I had a fairly difficult time with at least half the bosses, a select few taking over ten tries each.  But, most importantly, there are the bosses. In my opinion there were no bad bosses in this game at all. Each boss now has a first and second stage which creates some of the best boss fights that i've experienced in video games. Last but definitely not least is the soundtrack. Some of the tracks may not be as memorable as some of the ones in the original Dark Souls but especially once you get to the later game content it will blow you away. Everything from epic choirs chanting, violins, horns and there's even a harpsichord in some of the pieces. One of the pieces has the harpsichord as it's main instrument which you barely see these days. All in all, this is definetly one of my favorite games of all time. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to  git gud  and veterans of the series will feel right at home. A solid 10 out of 10."

        "Comments": "Posted: February 14, 2018              I'm just going to say it. I'm a picky mother â¥â¥â¥â¥er.When I was 8 years old, I played Shadow of the colossus for the first time in my life, and for the longest time no game surpassed the experience I had with that game.No matter what game I played I would always unfairly compare it to shadow of the colossus and be dissapointed by it. A friend recommended dark souls to me so I started playing the games. I started with demon's souls, then dark souls 2, then played a bit of dark souls. But this one is the first I finished completely. And I think I found a match for SotC.The Music:Very much like SotC this game is mostly silent, and the only sounds you hear are the sounds of ambience and the sounds of swords and spells when fighting. This is really atmospheric to me since it feels as though the game knows fighting is a normal thing you'll have to do, and it doesn't treat fighting like a special event triggering a battle song or anything. It chooses to play its music in very specific moments, like boss battles or specific areas like firelink shrine. The story:This is where I find dark souls shining more than SotC. Don't get me wrong, The story of SotC is amazing, one of the best in videogames imo, but I don't like to be spoon fed information, I like finding things out on my own. Which was partly the experience I had with SotC since at the time I didn't know english so the subtitles didn't help much.But that's the beauty of Dark souls, everything is up to the player to find out if they want to. The game risks the possibility  of being called a hard game with no story since it's not given to you.YOU HAVE to find the story. You decide wether or not you go seeking for it. And that's great.The feeling:This is where this game just ARGH, WHERE IT GETS ME HARD.So, I didn't know this for the longest time, but apparently the reason why I had such fond memories of SotC was because It's just you. It's just you and no one else. No one lives in the forbidden land, you are on your own.No one gives you advice, nothing, it's just you, the mission, and the adventure. This is why I loved darksouls too. There are npcs, so you are not completely alone, but the adventure is very much lonely. You are an adventurer going through castles with monsters in em andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you want help, do it. But now that I'm on my second play through of the game, I decided to not co-op bosses, and man does it feel way more rewarding and genuine.This game made me go back. It's the first time in a long time where me and my friends share information about hidden stuff and not search it up online in a wiki. It really does feel like I'm playing my ps2 again. This is the only game that's made me feel that way in a while. Dark souls gets a lot of praise, and it deserves all of it. Just buy the damn game."

The game has a few minor problems but they haven't taken away much from the game in my experience. The net-code for online/PVP is horrific so you can expect quite a few laggy phantoms although co-op seems to work fine and the password system makes it far easier to play with friends.A worthy successor to the original."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 27, 2016              (Just a pre warning, I was already a fan of dark souls so my opinion might seem slightly Biased)TL:DR : You should pick this game up if you are a fan of the souls games for sure and even if you are not it's worth the money in my opinion. Also my playtime is fa;se as I play offline sometimes ( one of my characters has clocked about 70 hours.)I'm going to keep it short as I could ramble on forever about Dark Souls 3. It's combat system keeps true to the  tried and tested  souls formula- challenging but rewarding. For example, if you hit an enemy with it's shield up with a spear type weapon you will be staggered, leaving you open for an attack by the enemy, but if you get your timings down you can dodge that attack and go in for an easy strike at the enemy. I also hav eto say the booses in this game are supurb,(***SPOILER ALERT***) I particularly like the abyss watchers as it had the perfect transition of fighting the one abyss watcher, then another comes in and you think your totally going to get killed, but then another watcher comes in to fight the others and your thinking that this fight just got easy again... until you realise that that fight was only the first phase, an dnow you have to fight one  beefed up  abyss watcher with a slightly different move set.(***SPOILERS OVER***) However the game does have flaws, the first beeing more tied to the playerbase. When you go to invade another player they are usually in a group of summons, making it a near impossible fight. The next is a number of glitches such as going to a certain area first forces an npc to skip an area and other things like not being able see the animations of other players in pvp. However in conclusion I believe that dark souls 3 is the perfect game for a souls fan, or even a person just looking for a bit of a challenge ;)"

However the experience of the first game [Dark Souls] is by far the best of the series, this game does a much better job of having great Quality Of Life."

The problem though is the lack of a poise system in pvp resulting in battles of  first hits  and baiting. Another issue is the atmosphere in the game, its drab and borning, which fits the premise of a world falling apart (like ashes), but that doesn't excuse the fact that the PVP area then becomes boring too."

I found it easy yet annoyingly slow and sluggish, which could be because I was playing on the ps4 at the time. I swore I would never play another Darksouls game again because to me Dark souls 2 was utter garbage. With that said I decided to give Dark souls 3 a chance to drag me into this franchise that many people seem to think is good. I must say I believe I'm starting to understand why people enjoy the Dark Souls series. The game can be challenging I wont say hard because if you use your head in combat and focus on building your character the way you like it than it's not hard. What I have come to love about Dark Souls 3 is the focus on character progression, This game is centered around it and if you don't focus on your character progression you will be punished in certain places in the game. With all this said I believe that this game is beautiful and well built the controls could use a bit more work however they dont make the game unplayable."

I could talk about for like ages and ages how incredible the atmosphere is, or the visual- and world design, original soundtrack and the implementation of the lore into the gameplay and the world itself, but all of that has been written before, all across the web. And no, Dark Souls is not only about how hard is it, this trilogy offers something which you just can not find in any other title (besides Demon's Souls and Bloodborne). Since I played FROMSOFTWARE's masterpieces, I can't truly enjoy and sink hours and hours into other games anymore...Why would I? I have Dark Souls."

I think those are because whole areas are still loaded (for phantoms, probably) and i hope if i ask veeeerrryy kindly (and if this is true) you will fix this.these are my only major complains. thanks FromSoft (and other companies) that made this absolute masterpiece of a franchise possible <333333333"

I feared I couldn't run this game with a GeForce 750 ti, but it runs very nicely on medium-high settingsActive patches and updatesCons...Arguably weaker PvP than in previous games due to quicker healing, certain weapons and very common phantom gangbangs where it's one invader vs the host and three phantoms. I enjoy it mostly but I can see why people are upset about itNG+ doesn't add very much apart from some new item placements and scaled enemy damage/HPWhere the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did poise go!?DLC is unpromising, since Ariandel was so shortArmour is no longer upgradable and shields are pretty uselessAt least a million pointless or unneeded DS1 referencesFinal verdictDS3 is great fun and is worthy of a lot of praise, but I feel it struggles to find its own identity and offers a weaker post-game experience than its predecessors.

        "Comments": "Posted: October 29, 2016              Years from now, Dark Souls III is going to be known as the  Ocarina of Time  of the series. Compared to the previous Souls games: artifical difficult has been replaced by unique and skillful execution, quality of life nuisances have been remedied, and sound/visuals have been improved drastically. In a nutshell, the biggest difference in Dark Souls III is that you aren't being tested for your patience/discipline. DS3 tests you for your skill. In DS1/2, dying was infuriating, and winning was a relief. In DS3, dying is awe-inspiring, and winning makes you feel like a lord. I whole-heartedly recommend you get this game. As soon as I got it, I couldn't stop playing it (I put in 68 hours over 5 weeks while working full-time and going to school). It is not flawless, but it is a clear 9/10. It's quite a enjoyable and rewarding experience.Also, in your times of struggle, remember that every death is meant to be a lesson. The game wants you to succeed.MechanicsWeapons are extremely unique and most of them are viable in PvE. You get to just pick whatever you want and feel like the badass that you want. Boss weapons are not impossible to come by and often feel the best. There are also many more choices for each weapon based on their  arte , which are more than just a guard break or a lunge forward. The movement/dodge system is much faster and more responsive. This would be very OP in previous Dark Souls games, but enemies in previous DS titles also were hard countered by circle-backstab anyway. The rolls in this game are appropriately needed for the changes in enemy move sets. It overall just feels better just to run around and battle.The convenants and merchants are infinitely less cumbersome than previous. Discovering a merchant relocates them to Firelink Shrine, in which all merchants and most NPCs will stay. You won't have to go traveling for 4 minutes just to get your weapon upgraded after you buy some pyromancies anymore. Convenants are also joined by being given a Sigil following discovery. You can just swap convenants by switching this slot in your inventory instead of hunting down the convenant leader again. Also, a merchant dying no longer means that you lose their products. All in all, it is much less of a chore to do small tasks like these.The equivalent of being human is called being Embered. Unlike in previous games, this is actually useful (you get 30% extra hp). This means that more people embered overall = more PvP interaction. Also, you gain embered status for beating a boss, which means more people want to put down their summon sign to help out others with a tough boss. Summoning also has a level limit, so you don't have to be scared of getting invaded from someone light years ahead of you in levels/gear. All of these mechanics lead to greater and more meaningful player interaction throughout your time in Lothric.You get to warp between bonfires from the get-go, and you also don't have to upgrade specific bonfires. Some have complained that this makes the world feel a bit smaller, but I disagree. The world is extremely connected save 1 or 2 exceptions, and you can see almost every other point in the game from one another. Bonfires are also a bit more on rails, meaning that it's tough to miss one. Previously, hidden bonfires (especially in the Tomb of the Giants in DS1) could completely change the flow of how you play the game based on whether you stumble upon it or not. There's also a generally lower amount of arbitraryâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that would punish you for lack of prior knowledge.The weapon crafting system no longer punishes you for making a choice. You can simply swap the properties of a +10 weapon instead of having to find another one and go through the full upgrade path each time. The information about each weapon is much easier to process and there are more choices for whatever nuianced build you're trying. The menu overall is extremely good. You can finally navigate on a grid instead of a list, and you can tab between menus for your armor/weapons. You can have more rings and items equipped simultaneously. You can also view your status to see how many souls you need for a next level instead of stopping by a specific location. It is overall just much easier on the eyes, and it is optimized to provide convenient access to information.CombatThe bosses follow suit in the weapons improvement, and (with few exceptions) they all feel varied and deep. I've fought some bosses almost 40 times and will still see some new moves. The AI is also programmed well enough to show human tendencies like getting greedy or faking out a move. You would be able to look up a guide on these most bosses and still not find the secret to beating them. In previous DS games, it felt like you would cheese all of the bosses because they'd cheese you (just walk near them and stand behind every boss). Sometimes, you'll want to intentionally separate yourself from a boss as much as possible. Some bosses have moves to punish you positioning close; other bosses have moves to punish you for rolling as a reaction to anything. DS3 bosses have several move sets that keep it fresh several times over. I never noticed how terribly annoying previous Dark Souls bosses were (from walking to each boss to the small gimmicks and lack of tactics) until realizing how good it could be when I played DS3.Honorable mention is that the Final Boss is an absolute beast. He is the summation of all who have ever Linked the Flame; therefore, his fight is the deepest and most  complete  that I could say I remember in a video game. He's not this way because he just  has a lot of stages  or takes 30 minutes to beat, but because he contains every popular player build and you will find something different each time you play him. There is also a bit of an emotional moment in which the music for Gwyn, the original Lord of Cinder, plays and he begins using Gwyn's sword. Sometimes you feel so emotionally connected with him, that you almost don't want to win. The normal enemies are what you would expect, but there is fortunately a bit less mob behavior. I thought that mob behavior was a bit of a cheap excuse for difficulty, and the AI programming and enemy design has made up that difficulty in a more meaningful way in DS3. I unfortunately don't know too much about serious PvP, but my experience with the invasions mechanics have been pleasant when fighting another player. It hasn't really felt unfair at all, yet. Performance & Audio/VisualDrastic performance increase. 60 fps, unlocked resolutions (I played in 1440p). The draw distance is excellent and the environments are stunning. You will find several  Oh my god  moments in which you are greeted by amazing views en route to a new area. For a little bit of preview, look up the screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. The armor and characters are also extremely sharp, and the in-game rendered cutscenes are Blizzard quality.The audio is overhauled. The directional sound in the game rivals Counter-Strike 1.6. The materials and general pitter-pattering is very precise and varied throughout. The sounds in the game are also overall very clear; play a bit of Dark Souls 1 and you will notice a staggering difference.The music is the best of any in the series. Several songs feel like a perfect fit for the environment/boss, instead of just sounding like generic background tunes. Pretty much any boss theme is great, but Abyss Watchers, Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Father Ariandel and Sister Friede (from the DLC), Twin Princes, and Oceiros get honorable mentions for great music. The Main Menu theme is pretty damn good, too."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 10, 2017              This game is more punishment than you bargained forThis game comes with a neat feature. If you experience a power outtage or even a BSOD caused by the game, the anticheat built into the game will automatically corrupt your save file.You lose everything. This blind retribution is invasive and unreasonable in its emboldened action of corrupting data on the consumer's PC.If they had banned me from online multiplayer, I could have still completed the game. Instead I lose my time spent and am told I need to start over from scratch due to the developer/publisher's poor judgement.UpdateThe first 80 hours were from the first playthrough. The game was not as fun the second time. Might just be that I have eidetic memory, but the mystery and confusion that the game series is known for was gone and it did not feel rewarding to complete it all the second time. I had made it to Lothric Castle the first playthrough (the one that was corrupted), completed all DLC as well, and I had that much of the game to replay just to get a sense of the ending,After playing all 3 Dark Souls games, I can really only endorse the first game. The level/world design of the first game was unrivaled with each game becoming more linear and less  swiss cheese-like  in how interconnected each area is to the whole rest of the world. This interconnectedness made the first souls game so very amazing.This game feels too polished and lacks the clunkyness of real world armored combat that the first game had. The weight of the movesets was a mechanic unto itself, where learning the timing and reach of the weapons were essential to successfully finishing an enemy before their hits connect.This game feels too much like Devil May Cry with all the fancy movesets. I would rather play Lords of the Fallen than this game.5/10Feels more generic and far less mysterious and confusing than first Dark Souls. Lack of mystery affords less rewarding experience for accomplishing anything in the game because it is too straight forward. Glad they are not making a 4th Dark Souls as it would be too diluted from the original formula to be anything worth playing."

There's a fine line between being difficult for the sake of being unnecessarily difficult and being difficult to provide a challenging experience and DS3 gets as close to that line as possible without crossing it. The experience is challenging throughout without seeming totally unfair.The community is (generally) very kind and eager to help others.After a point, the game loses it's replayability though. The New Game prestige system doesn't offer much extra to the game other than stronger versions of rings previously acquired- the game becomes much more PvP centric after two or three playthroughs."

I later found out I did not have enough VRAM, which, if you dont know, means basically I was crashing fairly quickly, every time I opened Dark Souls 3. Two things kept me around; The very common autosave, which meant everything I did was saved save for maybe a fight or two, and just how good this game is. I spent my first 150 hours just *suffering*, crashing every 10 minutes, sometimes right after bossfights, fast enough that I lost all the progress. I got discouraged, but just how much I love Dark Souls, in particular 3, made me come back. Another 10 minutes. Get just a bit farther. I hit a wall block around 3/4th through the game, and wanted to scream. That boss made me want to crack my eyeballs open. But thats the thing. No matter how much he infuriated me, it only determined me to get farther. Few bosses will flat out destroy you before phase 2, meaning you will almost always at least get halfway, before dying. It always says  you got this far, do it twice! . Some bosses just seem unbeatable, and then you pull through, and destroy them. I havent even played Dark Souls 1, and I love this. I did play DS2 and Bloodborne, didnt get very far in either, and I am glad I knew beforehand DS2 is a black sheep among the souls games, so I knew the others werent as. . .floaty. Everything has lore. I have only played Dark Souls 3, and even by extension, I have learned a ton of lore. This might be because there is a massive amount of nods to DS1. DS2 is a bit kicked to the side, but it has a few nods here and there.For me, Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece. It has its flaws. But thats the important aspect of games. If a game has a lot of flaws, the rest of the game had better be good as hell to make up for it.I had a friend that quit because of how muchâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥this game throws at you, and all the hidden stuff the game will never flat out say. The only reason I might have stayed this long is because before I went in I read up on a lot of stuff. I found out what makes most people quit before I went in, and this probably lowered the whole shock of everything for me. All I can say in regards to the rating? 8.5/10. Its a great game, and I think anyone should give it a try. More of a try than most games, for just how hard and unforgiving this game can be. If you can push through, what remains is a fantastic piece of work."

Instead they wanted to make the game more  casual freindly  by ruining it for both hardcore and casual fans. I honestly compare this game most to BloodBorne. The combat feels almost ripped straight from it. This is a game that has made it clear that it doesn't matter how hard you hit, all that matters is that you hit first. Almost any hit by any enemy will stagger you, causing you to have to restart your attack animation. Basically, 95% of weapons that aren't broadswords or rapiers are complete trash, because by the time you can actually get an attack off with your greatsword, an enemy will have bitten off almost half of your health. And when you do get that attack off, congrats, you took away a fifth of it's health.The worst part I'd say in my opinion is enemies no longer use tactics. In DS1 enemies would try to flank you, they would time their attacks for when it's assumed that your guard is down the most. In this game, they just follow the strategy of keep attacking until you run out of stamina and are forced to take a hit. The only way to properly beat an enemy is to just keep stunlocking them and PRAY you don't run out of stamina. Meanwhile enemies can attack for years before they start to break a sweat. I was fighting a knight in the Cathedral of the Deep with a greatsword, and this guy, no joke, constantly swung his sword for a minute while I kept dodging and chipping away at his tank of a health bar. What I was trying to do was roll around him and get a cheeky backstab, but because the game's tracking is so good it's bad, that's near impossible. He just kept swinging away without a care in the world. The big problem with this is it creates a disbalance in the game. In DS1, enemies had a limitation similar to you. They were limited by stamina. They may be able to go for a while, but at some point they'll run out of energy and have to stop for a Gatorade and a Powerbar. That creates a game that is always balanced. This is what people talked about when they said that Dark Souls is hard but fair. Your enemies are limited in the same way you are. That goes out the window in this game though!As I said, they already had the game perfect at Dark Souls 1. All they had to do was polish it up and fix some bugs, maybe a few balancing tweeks here and there, get some good servers, and that was it. Instead they tried to make BloodBorne 2.5 and failed at it because they forgot what made Dark Souls great."

It has the graphical style of both the first Dark Souls and Bloodborne, has combat pacing that is faster and more intense, had beautifully designed environments, has all the references you could every need, and will chizle you into the player you've always wanted to be. And best of all, it is fun as heck.With that said: buy the game and git gud"

If you have played the other souls games front to back, be it dark or demon souls, or bloodborne for that matter, this game is definitely for you. If you tried another souls game but found it (a little) too hard or frustrating, or you have never played a souls game before, then i suggest you skip this one for now. Play the other Souls game to end. as FromSoftware really upped their difficulty this time around, Dark Souls 3 could be an extremely frustrating experience for newer Souls players. I give it a 9.5/10."

It seems like such a fun game, but I was initially turned off, because of people saying how hard Dark Souls is in general. Dark Souls III is very fair in terms of difficulty. When I die, I know where I messed up. I can't stop recommending this game though. Every aspect of it is just so great. The level design, sound direction, music, lore, bosses, enemies, customization, everything is just great. I enjoyed every aspect of this game. The multiplayer is great too with both invasions and co op. It's fun to go back to a previous boss and help someone with a boss they just can't beat. Invasions can be anything from hanging out with the invader to getting someone so mad they comment on your profile insulting you, because you killed them. I absolutely love this game."

Imo Dark souls 1 bosses were harder and more challanging than Dark souls 3 however the bosses are memorable each with unigue designs and feels to them. The atmosphere looks and feels great with the ash and dark theme expected from a Dark souls game. This is my favorite of the two I've played and i recommend this piece of ash."

Darks Souls 2 was such a great start for the series, and when they made dark souls after it was alright. The bosses have no creativity, and all the normal enemies suck. They obviously saw how good battlefield 1 was doing and ripped it off. then don't even get me started on the armor and weapons, since they have about 5 weapons to choose from through out the entire game. The lore in this game sucks because all anyone ever talks about is lighting some fire. Then lastly they have no micre transactions at all which literally makes the game impossible to even fathom playing. If you plan on buying a game for 60 bucks spend on something good like odyssey reborn."

The problem though is the lack of a poise system in pvp resulting in battles of  first hits  and baiting. Another issue is the atmosphere in the game, its drab and borning, which fits the premise of a world falling apart (like ashes), but that doesn't excuse the fact that the PVP area then becomes boring too."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 22, 2016              This review is my opinion of dark souls 3 written after killing every boss and finishing my first playthrough. Warning: long review, non-native English speaker, mostly praise. While dark souls 1 is my favorite game of all time, dark souls 3 can easily be my top 4 games of all time alone, despite my love towards the franchise. Itâs sad to see that dark souls 3 is the last game for its series, but I look forward to play its DLC and more awesome games made by From software.Boss fights: there are about 20 bosses in total in dark souls 3. All of them are not easy and require a lot of death to figure out the right strategies.  The satisfying feeling that I get after mastering the mechanic after countless death and finally beating the bosses is what makes these fights great.  Every boss fight has its unique theme, music, and they all have different phrases when the bosses become more powerful. About half of the boss fights are designed really well that are really memorable. Several boss fights have reached the level of epicness that I have never experienced in any other games. Theme/graphic/music: the world of dark souls 3 is dark and beautiful. The world is full of details: different designs for the thrones of lords that match their lore, cells that are full of decayed bodies but still tell stories of their prisoners through furniture and items, areas leading to bosses and boss rooms that amplified the power of different bossesâ¦ The world is as pretty as some other games like the witcher 3 and farcry, but the music is better in my opinion. The music for different areas and boss fights are so in tone with the game that makes me even want to go back to fight the bosses again after so many death and finally beating them. Bosses may be strong, but they are not as strong as the tones created by the piano and violin in those music. Interconnected world: dark souls 1 has most of its worlds interconnected to each other. This level of world design has never been reached by another game for so many years after the game came out. While dark souls 3 has not reached the same level, it is obvious throughout the game that the developer tried to make maps interconnected. As a result, there are a lot of shortcuts that connect different sections of the same area or different areas that would not normally connect to each other. Finding those shortcuts enriches the experience of exploring the world.Weapons/armors: while weapons and armors are similar to DS1 &2, 2 important changes are made. 1. Each weapon now has a special attack that used mana to cast. This makes weapons more unique, and it would have greater impact on PVP than PVE. 2. Weapons can be upgraded, but armors and shields can no longer be leveled up. This greatly reduces the defense of mid-late game characters. Leveling up defense items and tank a lot of hits is no long an options in DS3. This change makes mid-late game PVE more challenging, and it can create a lot of build varieties in PVP. I think people call this the return of the fashion soul. Lore: while the witch 3 has the best lore and storytelling among all the games, souls game focus on actions, and DS3 chooses the right approach to tell its story. The game doesnât tell its story directly. The player needs to learn about the story through hints around the world. Itâs easy to miss the details of the story if not paying attention to item descriptions and connecting the dots between dialogs of NPCs. To me, this is the prefect approach: the action of the game is good enough, and if the player wants to learn more about the lore, it is free to do so, and there are plenty to learn. The story of dark souls is simple yet complicated, and dark souls 3 finally completes the cycle of the whole story. The faiths of god, fire, humanity, and undead are all depend on the choice of the player.Return of the old elements from pervious souls games: several areas of the game and characters have returned from pervious souls games to dark souls 3. This is truly amazing for a souls fan.   Combat/difficulty: combat is faster than pervious souls games and more punishing. Weaker defense and spells make it hard to tank a lot of hits or stay in safe distance to spam magic. Again, dark souls focus on actions, and there is simply no better games in the market so far in term of action/movement of the character. While I wishes some bosses have more HP and leave less open windows for the player to attack, the hard ones are hard enough. The first boss(tutorial boss) is actually challenging for me: a not-so-noob player, and it really showcases the principle of this game: dodging and timing. Dying a lot and losing all the hard earned souls is mandatary, but that is how a soul game should be played. Co-op: while I didnât choose to co-op for any of my game progression, co-op and invade are easy and fun. I did tried some PVP, and it seems there are very few pure casters since spells are much weaker in DS3 comparing to DS1 and 2. People use spells mostly for buffs. In short, dark souls 3 worth its full price, and itâs definitely one of the best games Iâve ever played. I tried to explore the world as much as I can during my first playthrough, and Iâm sad it âonlyâ last for around 60 hours. It was such a good time for every single minute I spent on this game. Iâd definitely suggest anyone to play this game. Also, try to play the game with minimum guides/coop for progression during the first playthrough. It will make the experience much better."

I was quite hesitant purchasing this as at the time I only played a little bit of Dark Souls, and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy it. So I thought I'd probably drop this game after a couple of hours. But my God, this game blew me away. Easily now one of my favourite games of all time. The challenges in the game are hard, but they're fair. So you never really have 'this level/boss is impossible' feeling.It also rewards you with many weapons, armour, spells and much more. This adds massive replayablity to the game as you can experiment with different builds. Oh, and the use of multiplayer in this game is fantastic. Also for summoning, out of the other Souls games I've played (DS1 and BB) this has the best summoning and multiplayer system. Though one problem I have is a common trend among the Souls series. It's the lack of information that FromSoftware gives to the player. I admit that during my play throughs I'd still have to google what a certain item actually does. However, some people may like this curiosity so they explore different items by themselves. An enjoyable experience either way. TL;DR: Buy this game."

This makes it so risky to even have your ember active online, especially in areas with certain PvP covens accociated with them. If you play offline, you've probably never seen this issue and will never be in this position. However, part of the journey in every Souls game I've played is being invaded by a random naked ninja or some jackass with the symbol of avarice, and overcoming these invasions is one of the most invigorating things these games have to offer.

Obviously From needs to fix this issue, but I believe that such a fix will take a while to drop; From has a lot on their agenda right now, I'd imagine. Between working on DLC, maintaining servers for all three platforms, creating patches for all three platforms, and working on their new IP, it may take some time.Nevertheless, Dark Souls 3 is amazing and should be treated as such. I hope From solves the softbanning issue in the near distant future, but in the mean time, appreciate the game for what it is.EDIT: Because I am trying to 100% this game, I actually have to play PvP in order to get certain covenant rewards that are required to 100%. This makes the issue of hacking PvP players that could get me soft banned even more prevelent for me.EDIT 2: So I just watched Oroboro's video on the state of Dks3 PvP at the moment, and I agree with a lot of what he has to say. If you haven't seen the video, and care about PvP or the game in general, I highly suggest watching. What he says in the video rings true for all platforms (PS4, Xbox, PC) and really makes me sad when I think about it. I love this game. I loved my first two playthroughs and my NG+ playthrough, I love the lore and the settings, I love the design and fighting styles of 90% of the bosses, and I love most of the weapons in the game. However, I have to PvP in order to 100% the game, and it is just so hard on PC. PC players have to deal with the ganking and massive disadvanages for invading that is pretty much the same on all platforms, along with having the issues of softbanning and severely limited control (if you don't have a proper controller). All of this combined with the sad truth that I am very mediocre when it comes to PvP, what is left for someone like me? Note - I still love this game for everything it does right, and I still highly recommend it. I just wish that From had spent more time with PvP to tweek and change the state of it before launch."

If you have played the other souls games front to back, be it dark or demon souls, or bloodborne for that matter, this game is definitely for you. If you tried another souls game but found it (a little) too hard or frustrating, or you have never played a souls game before, then i suggest you skip this one for now. Play the other Souls game to end. as FromSoftware really upped their difficulty this time around, Dark Souls 3 could be an extremely frustrating experience for newer Souls players. I give it a 9.5/10."

Pros:- Game world is truly stunning- The game is challenging, even the most basic enemies can slaughter you with ease if you aren't careful- Pieces of lore that tie in nicely to the previous games- Rewarding item drops - your exploration and effort is rewarded and there is a ton of unique gear through out the game world- Not completely tied in to a linear approach  (I missed an entire area and story boss that I had to go back for)- The community is respectful, upon summoning a co-op partner there is always a bow or a wave and the same when you help them complete their boss battle- FPS is solid and load times on my solid state are almost instantCons:- The  fog wall  at the Shrine. Whilst not game breaking, it's a little frustrating the area doesn't load at once- If you're interested in a PvP element and have never played a Souls game, there is no balance. You are randomly put in to another players world. I regularly have invaders come in to my world whilst I have 2 sunbros so it's immediately 3v1 (not to mention any equipment disparity)- There are a few problems around summoning phantoms, 60% will come up  timed out  or  unable to summon phantom - Server lag is pretty bad at times, though it appears to have eased in recent days (24/04/16). So, should you buy it?Absolutely, yes. I haven't had this much fun in a game since Witcher 3. It's punishing and abusive but I keep going back for more. Such is the Dark Souls relationship."

        "Comments": "Posted: July 9, 2017              My first Souls game. I was quite hesitant purchasing this as at the time I only played a little bit of Dark Souls, and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy it. So I thought I'd probably drop this game after a couple of hours. But my God, this game blew me away. Easily now one of my favourite games of all time. The challenges in the game are hard, but they're fair. So you never really have 'this level/boss is impossible' feeling.It also rewards you with many weapons, armour, spells and much more. This adds massive replayablity to the game as you can experiment with different builds. Oh, and the use of multiplayer in this game is fantastic. Also for summoning, out of the other Souls games I've played (DS1 and BB) this has the best summoning and multiplayer system. Though one problem I have is a common trend among the Souls series. It's the lack of information that FromSoftware gives to the player. I admit that during my play throughs I'd still have to google what a certain item actually does. However, some people may like this curiosity so they explore different items by themselves. An enjoyable experience either way. TL;DR: Buy this game."

It's not for casual players, but for ones looking for really hardcore challenge. I also played the first edition of this game - prepare to die - and it taught me that 3rd part will not be any easier, damn, it's even harder than first one, and that's why I love it!This game is not about mindlessly rushing fordward, happly slaughtering anything you'll see, by doing so you are only going to meet your death even more often than before. In Dark Souls series, every enemy needs to be taken on rather strategically, especially minibosses like Crystal Lizard or elite enemies like Black Knight - this enemy will give you a lot of pain if you underestimate him, as his 3 blows are usually enought to remove your guts. During this duel, you have to learn his moveset in order to beat him.PROS-Ultra challenging-Fighting system-Huge world-Amazing hidden story-Lots of connections to the first DS-Many possible builds-Teaches you to never give up-One of best TPRPG games I played so far-Crazy, unique bosses, usually with intresting story behind-Motherf- mimics-Dead enemy ragdolsCONS-Hitboxes. Goddamn broken hitboxes-Makes casuales cry-Cancerous builds in PvP, like two Greatswords, Estoc or Gargoyle Fire Spear, which requies no skill to kill you and it'a unbalanced with damage, attack speed and stuns-Overleveled players can attack new characters-Ganking"

Playing this as someone who's been through two of the games already is probably different from someone who doesn't already knows their stuff. It's a great series, but I went into this thing knowing how to dodge roll and to not have equipment load over 70% and all that stuff. Someone who comes into this game not knowing theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥might not have such an easy time of it. So overall, I'd say this is the easiest Dark Souls I've played, but geez I sort of have been training hard for these things, you know?What I can say compared to other games:- The Co-op is fun, but there isn't a dual boss like Ornstein and Smough, the Sentinels, the Throne Guardians, those two â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tigers or whatnot. Dark Souls is a challenging game and there is nothing that builds an everlasting friendship than in going up against a boss and trusting your back to a friend. - There are a lot of AI holes you can exploit. I found a bunch of spots where enemies would refuse to advance on you because they apparently are not supposed to leave their designated zones. Maybe it's because I'm savvy to how the games work, but still. - The Fashion Souls game is alright, but I never found anything like the Desert Sorceress outfit. :( - The story is... great. I'm really looking forward to VaatiVidya videos for this one. Special shout out to the moments where you go to the Abyssal Firelink Shrine. In any case, Dark Souls is great. I look forward to DLCs."

        "Comments": "Posted: December 28, 2017              Dark Souls III is absolutely incredible! There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, but here's a few things that may help someone on the fence about buying:    If you're like me, and you generally avoid M-rated games, don't let DS3's ESRB rating scare you away. It plays much more like a T-rated game, especially considering that the blood effects can be disabled.    The technical side of the game is passable, but nothing special. There's a 60FPS cap, black bars on any non-16:9 display, and microstuttering if you have certain video or controller drivers. Thankfully, the black bars can be fixed with a quick hex edit or popular mod, and the microstutter can be alleviated (in my experience) by using older controller drivers as well as the latest video drivers. The 60FPS cap is better left in place, as the game flips out at higher framerates.    While you can play this with KB+M, DS3 was clearly designed for a controller. I highly recommend using a controller, but the KB+M controls are good enough that a few of my friends prefer it.    Speaking of friends, this game is a blast in multiplayer! DS3 is home to some of the best cooperative and competitive multiplayer experiences I've ever had."

This game made it difficult to put down, and I found myself swinging away and enjoying every boss fight (except curse-rotting greatwood). A few hours later, and I have started a new character, one whose play style I enjoy every bit as much as the original character. The game has a steep learning curve, and it is one of the best games I have played."

Yes it does use alot of nostalgia from the first Dark Souls (and bits from Dark Souls 2) but at the same time this is what makes Dark Souls 3. The fact that this is the last game and being able to award the player for showing refrences throughout the games is really pleasing. If you are a Souls veteran, get this game. If you are a Souls newbie, get this game I promise it is totally worth your time. (despite of the janky FPS (using a GTX 970) at times)"

Played from the first day until the day that most of the unkindled finally burned out.Gameplay wise, it's still the same Dark Souls. The combat is rewarding. To be honest, if you fail at it, it's because you keep rushing in and not thinking. Only spamminh whatever the attack button is and not changing tactics. On the other hand, people who take their time to learn how things work wil be rewarded well. That said, it's still not a hyper fast paced game nor is it a slugfest, but it can be either with the right playstyle.On the bright side, any slow moments are rewarded by great attention to detail on the maps, lots of secrets and breathtaking views. I personally love the  after the end  feel of the game.The community is a mixed batch. A lot of people do have some pride and honour. There have been countless times i was invaded and have invaded where the  Enemy  and myself challenged each other to a duel with no estus or cheese tactic. There was no system to force either party to abide by those  rules , yet most people follow it. In many cases, when a 3rd party comes by to a duel, they'll often sit out and let the duel progress. Some hosts, players who summon phantoms, even create makeshift tournaments. Though, if you try to break duel  rules  in any form, expect full retribution from both your opponent and any bystanders who also honour those duels.On the other hand, there are still hackers and cheese builds. There are toxic people who only want to kill. There's also the infamous gank squad who hunt in numbers... but they're all not too bad as long as you don't invade. If you have the first DLC, you can duel in a fairly fair battleground.Tl;dr, get the game. On sale or not, it is worth it."

Its beautiful to look at and play for the first time. You'll die a lot but if you commit to it you'll come back stronger each time and slowly and surely you'll make progress and come to appreciate what a beautiful piece of art this game is."

Dark Souls III offers a more polished (noob Friendly) set of mechanics and the enemies are more forgiving. Great game to sink plenty of hours into. It's a game that new players to the Souls series can get into and have a blast."

The online community is very active in both PVP and Co-op. There is a lot of content in the game, so you can invest a lot of time in it."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 12, 2016              tl;dr: amazing game, servers are buggy, sorry for anyone having the crashes, get it when its updated and fixed.I can recommend this game, as I am not having any problems with crashes, low fps, or any performance related things. The only thing I can complain about is online not being accessible right now. I'm not sure if this is a widespread problem, but I was able to connect yesterday, and not today. I'm only assumming its because of the massive amount of traffic.Combat is as fluid as it ever was in the series, best feeling so far. There's a new learning curve that will throw players of the previous Souls games for a loop. Enemy AI is very aggressive, which is nice to see. Original Dark Souls'  poise is back as well, which is all I could have asked for. A minor complaint is bonfire placement, but it can easily be overlooked. At some points, bonfires seem to be placed too far or close to each other, making one part of the area feel very easy, and the other part feel like a gauntlet. Bosses don't dissapoint, as there are actually interesting designs, mechanics, and arenas to fight in. Having only played the PC version for 5 hours, as well as exploring in the network test, the amount of content in areas is very dense. Having played only the first few areas, and gotten roughly half of the amount of weapons that Bloodborne had in the entire game, Dark Souls III makes a return to form in player choice on playstyle. Starting classes aren't solely specialized in Dex or Strength, or Magic as well. There are now what seem like hybrid classes, like the Herald or the Mercenary, being Strength/Faith and Quality builds respectively. Weapon Artes are also a staggeringly good addition to the franchise. Having more fluid and less predictable moves, along with being able to equip three weapons, make for a more engaging and intimate combat system, with PvE and PvP alike. Branching paths in areas, new weapons, and the wonderful addition of Weapon Artes make choice in this game extremely deep and engaging.Graphically, it's beautiful. It doesn't have the most polygons as other next gen titles. However, it has some of the most beautiful textures, use of depth of field, and overall some of the most interesting designs I've seen in a while. This game will most likely hold up graphically for many years to come. The cloth physics are amazing, character design and settings are beautiful, and lighting is gorgeous. The world is depressing and dark, but there are still splotches of beautiful contrasting colour found throughout Lothric. From the Giant Crystal Lizards azure sheen to the Undead Settlements stunning fires, the game knows when to throw a little bit of colour to keep your palette interested. Again, I've had little frame dips, no crashes, no low FPS. My graphics card is an nVidia 860GTX (2GB), I have 16GB of RAM, and an Intel i7, and am running the game off of an SSD. I would hope that no problems would come from a bit of a hefty rig. It's ashame that so many negative reviews are given out from not being able to play the game, as its amazing thus far. The developers do need to fix this however, and I'm sorry for anyone who has payed 55-60 dollars for the game, (or even more if they bought the season pass) and isn't able to play. My main qualm is sever issues. I've only been able to play online once. At first, I was consistently getting the message  Unable to log into Dark Souls III game servers. Press 'OK' to try to reconnect.  I tried this for about 45 minutes before giving up. Then, later that night, it worked, and I was in the server. However, today I have been constantly getting the message again and again. I must have tried at least 10 times, giving each time 15 minutes. Its infuriating because I would like to enjoy PvP and Co-op with my friend. Although the minor upset about the server issues, this whole game is a masterpiece. I'm glad there are still developers who create more or less Triple A titles, and still put this much passion, polish, and content into their work. If you have any interest in this game, or RPGs in general, I would wait for the crashing/frames fix, and pick it up not a second later. It's a wonderful game that really doesn't treat you like an iimbecile, which is nice to see in an industry that treats players like idiots."

Buy I can tell you now, I was wrong (you still might be right btw).This isn't just a pray you don't get killed game, you make peace with dying quick... Or should at least. There is so much lore in this game that I'm going to play through again once I've finished it (not even close yet) to play with a full guide. Strategy, dodging, not using the estus button to fight is key in defeating any enemy you encounter. Diablo is for noobs. Try it out. It's so cheap. On humble bundle. I do however recommend a controller. Keyboard is playable but the keys are all weirdly placed."

It's not for casual players, but for ones looking for really hardcore challenge. I also played the first edition of this game - prepare to die - and it taught me that 3rd part will not be any easier, damn, it's even harder than first one, and that's why I love it!This game is not about mindlessly rushing fordward, happly slaughtering anything you'll see, by doing so you are only going to meet your death even more often than before. In Dark Souls series, every enemy needs to be taken on rather strategically, especially minibosses like Crystal Lizard or elite enemies like Black Knight - this enemy will give you a lot of pain if you underestimate him, as his 3 blows are usually enought to remove your guts. During this duel, you have to learn his moveset in order to beat him.PROS-Ultra challenging-Fighting system-Huge world-Amazing hidden story-Lots of connections to the first DS-Many possible builds-Teaches you to never give up-One of best TPRPG games I played so far-Crazy, unique bosses, usually with intresting story behind-Motherf- mimics-Dead enemy ragdolsCONS-Hitboxes. Goddamn broken hitboxes-Makes casuales cry-Cancerous builds in PvP, like two Greatswords, Estoc or Gargoyle Fire Spear, which requies no skill to kill you and it'a unbalanced with damage, attack speed and stuns-Overleveled players can attack new characters-Ganking"

Playing this as someone who's been through two of the games already is probably different from someone who doesn't already knows their stuff. It's a great series, but I went into this thing knowing how to dodge roll and to not have equipment load over 70% and all that stuff. Someone who comes into this game not knowing theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥might not have such an easy time of it. So overall, I'd say this is the easiest Dark Souls I've played, but geez I sort of have been training hard for these things, you know?What I can say compared to other games:- The Co-op is fun, but there isn't a dual boss like Ornstein and Smough, the Sentinels, the Throne Guardians, those two â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tigers or whatnot. Dark Souls is a challenging game and there is nothing that builds an everlasting friendship than in going up against a boss and trusting your back to a friend. - There are a lot of AI holes you can exploit. I found a bunch of spots where enemies would refuse to advance on you because they apparently are not supposed to leave their designated zones. Maybe it's because I'm savvy to how the games work, but still. - The Fashion Souls game is alright, but I never found anything like the Desert Sorceress outfit. :( - The story is... great. I'm really looking forward to VaatiVidya videos for this one. Special shout out to the moments where you go to the Abyssal Firelink Shrine. In any case, Dark Souls is great. I look forward to DLCs."

I absolutely recommend this game without a doubt and its worth its price and im only 3-4 hours in and i love it already. I cannot wait to see what else this game has to offer."

If you enjoy games were your player doesnt get better you do. The game is incredable rewarding to play and beat especially if you do it solo. with around 120hours played and around 7 full play thoughs of the game. Its not the longest game and especially gets faster the more you play it. Just play it, its Dark Souls."

I already had one so it wasn't a problem but I can see that this game isn't meant to be played on keyboard and mouse. Besides that, the game is incredibely frustrating at first, but once you are able to get some hits and dogs the enemy's hits, it is incredibely fun to play and it's definetely worth your money.And, from what I've seen, the only reason why people DON'T like this game is because it's too hard when you get into it, so... :P"

        "Comments": "Posted: April 12, 2016              tl;dr: amazing game, servers are buggy, sorry for anyone having the crashes, get it when its updated and fixed.I can recommend this game, as I am not having any problems with crashes, low fps, or any performance related things. The only thing I can complain about is online not being accessible right now. I'm not sure if this is a widespread problem, but I was able to connect yesterday, and not today. I'm only assumming its because of the massive amount of traffic.Combat is as fluid as it ever was in the series, best feeling so far. There's a new learning curve that will throw players of the previous Souls games for a loop. Enemy AI is very aggressive, which is nice to see. Original Dark Souls'  poise is back as well, which is all I could have asked for. A minor complaint is bonfire placement, but it can easily be overlooked. At some points, bonfires seem to be placed too far or close to each other, making one part of the area feel very easy, and the other part feel like a gauntlet. Bosses don't dissapoint, as there are actually interesting designs, mechanics, and arenas to fight in. Having only played the PC version for 5 hours, as well as exploring in the network test, the amount of content in areas is very dense. Having played only the first few areas, and gotten roughly half of the amount of weapons that Bloodborne had in the entire game, Dark Souls III makes a return to form in player choice on playstyle. Starting classes aren't solely specialized in Dex or Strength, or Magic as well. There are now what seem like hybrid classes, like the Herald or the Mercenary, being Strength/Faith and Quality builds respectively. Weapon Artes are also a staggeringly good addition to the franchise. Having more fluid and less predictable moves, along with being able to equip three weapons, make for a more engaging and intimate combat system, with PvE and PvP alike. Branching paths in areas, new weapons, and the wonderful addition of Weapon Artes make choice in this game extremely deep and engaging.Graphically, it's beautiful. It doesn't have the most polygons as other next gen titles. However, it has some of the most beautiful textures, use of depth of field, and overall some of the most interesting designs I've seen in a while. This game will most likely hold up graphically for many years to come. The cloth physics are amazing, character design and settings are beautiful, and lighting is gorgeous. The world is depressing and dark, but there are still splotches of beautiful contrasting colour found throughout Lothric. From the Giant Crystal Lizards azure sheen to the Undead Settlements stunning fires, the game knows when to throw a little bit of colour to keep your palette interested. Again, I've had little frame dips, no crashes, no low FPS. My graphics card is an nVidia 860GTX (2GB), I have 16GB of RAM, and an Intel i7, and am running the game off of an SSD. I would hope that no problems would come from a bit of a hefty rig. It's ashame that so many negative reviews are given out from not being able to play the game, as its amazing thus far. The developers do need to fix this however, and I'm sorry for anyone who has payed 55-60 dollars for the game, (or even more if they bought the season pass) and isn't able to play. My main qualm is sever issues. I've only been able to play online once. At first, I was consistently getting the message  Unable to log into Dark Souls III game servers. Press 'OK' to try to reconnect.  I tried this for about 45 minutes before giving up. Then, later that night, it worked, and I was in the server. However, today I have been constantly getting the message again and again. I must have tried at least 10 times, giving each time 15 minutes. Its infuriating because I would like to enjoy PvP and Co-op with my friend. Although the minor upset about the server issues, this whole game is a masterpiece. I'm glad there are still developers who create more or less Triple A titles, and still put this much passion, polish, and content into their work. If you have any interest in this game, or RPGs in general, I would wait for the crashing/frames fix, and pick it up not a second later. It's a wonderful game that really doesn't treat you like an iimbecile, which is nice to see in an industry that treats players like idiots."

What is wrong tho? Barely nobody plays it now days. Those who do, are either die hard fans, hackers trying new scripts or anyone who has a connection that can only be described from the moon.cool game, would fab more.__________________________________Best souls game to date for me.Experience all the other dark souls series and i can firmly recomend this piece of art.The punishing and extrodinary rewarding experience is still there, packed with familiar aspects from the beloved dark souls 1, it is just perfect.Dark souls 3 also has the most memorable fights and encounters ever and i genuinly say it as the best among games.Plus the graphics ain't half bad, if you are looking for those kind of games. (actuality is among the most good looking)"

Darks Souls 2 was such a great start for the series, and when they made dark souls after it was alright. The bosses have no creativity, and all the normal enemies suck. They obviously saw how good battlefield 1 was doing and ripped it off. then don't even get me started on the armor and weapons, since they have about 5 weapons to choose from through out the entire game. The lore in this game sucks because all anyone ever talks about is lighting some fire. Then lastly they have no micre transactions at all which literally makes the game impossible to even fathom playing. If you plan on buying a game for 60 bucks spend on something good like odyssey reborn."

This game is the true sucessor to Dark Souls 1, and almost rivals it as my personal favorite game. The tight, precise combat we all know and love has come back more polished and refined than ever. The incredible dark atmosphere, epic and haunting soundtrack, creative and eerily magesitc enemy design, vast interconnected world and levels, characters you really care about, tragic lore that will make you want to cry, and fantastic boss fights are all back in spades. The game runs great on my system aside from some crashing problems at the Curse-Ridden Greatwood boss that have since been fixed. If you loved Dark Souls 1 but were disappointed with Souls 2, this is Miyazaki's gift to you. My only real complaint is that it does rely a bit heavily on fanservice and Dark Souls 1 nostalgia. However, this is a fantastic game and a fitting conclusion to the greatest game series of all time, with the best bosses and lore the series has to offer. Not all video games are art, but this one is without a doubt. 9.5/10"

I think it's about time, Ashen Ones...Well, I must open with the fact that I hadn't been a fan of Dark Souls games prior to playing and finishing Dark Souls III, I bought the Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls, but it was nearly unplayable on keyboard and mouse. I shrugged it off and went on with my life, playing other games.Eventually, I bought Scholar of the First Sin edition of Dark Souls II, it was quite a progress, this time around you could control the game on PC fairly comfortably, with some keybind changes you could perform all the special attacks without hassle, but... Dark Souls II just didn't pull me in... Most people say it's the weakest of the series, and now I can see why...Still, for some reason, I was quite enthusiastic about Dark Souls III and I had been anxiously awaiting its arrival. In-game footage videos seemed great, it looked like a fast paced, neat combat mechanics hardcore action RPG. So I bought it, this time with Steam controller (I wouldn't skip this one if the keyboard and mouse controls sucked, too much money! :D ) Fortunately, I must commend From Software, as Dark Souls III is officially the best PC port of their games to date. Not only is it comfortable to play using keyboard and mouse, in my humble opinion, it actually surpasses the controller! Those 180Â° degrees turns will simply never work so well on any controller. PC controls are tight, precise, no delay or feeling of slugishness, it's simply sublime.Now to the game!!If you're a fan of action RPG genre, or fantasy, or Japanese perfection of games development, you need to give Dark Souls III a go. Treat yourself, take a week off and just dive in. Submerge into the world thick with atmosphere where every enemy can be your doom if underestimated, to the world where you are constantly facing overwhelming odds.... and emerge victorious!! Beating this game is such a fulfilling goal, it's worth neglecting your wife/girlfriend/friends/family for. I love it... and hate it... and I know I will keep coming back, starting all over again and getting my face chopped off and handed to me again and again and again...TL:DRPros:- Perfect Dark Fantasy setting- Tons of weapons, catering to each and every preference of yours- Varied enemies who will keep killing you and making you hate your lack of skill- Subtle way of storytelling through NPCs and bits of lore you find throughout the gameCons:- Life is too short, I want to play more Dark Souls!!- It's so cool that you literally won't need nor wish to play any of those shiny new games you've just bought"

If you enjoy games were your player doesnt get better you do. The game is incredable rewarding to play and beat especially if you do it solo. with around 120hours played and around 7 full play thoughs of the game. Its not the longest game and especially gets faster the more you play it. Just play it, its Dark Souls."

Going from the console 30 FPS 900p lock to this beauty was a great treat.For my real review, I have to say that I'm one of the people in the DKS community where I don't think the game is hard persay. It's no hack-n-slash game. You need to learn the paterns. Knowing the game's paterns are key to enjoying it. You should learn something from every single death. Try not to make the same mistake twice. This goes for both PvE and PvP.Speaking of which, I'm not at all good at PvP, yet I still find fun out of it (when I'm not swearing at the person who just killed me). It's a whole other side of this game which, given time, can become the (dark) soul purpose you play this game.TLDR;Git gud, casul."

This game forces you to be very aware of your enemies and surroundings because you are never safe and never has a game allowed me to enjoy dying and retrying everytime. With 60 plus hours in already, and still not done with the base story I have found a new genre that i hope to love with every future Dark Souls game to come. I found this unknown jem in my gaming world because of a sale and boy am I sorry i did not buy this and previous installs earlier because i missed some great games. understanding the controls does take a minute especially with keyboard and mouse. But if you are a true pc gamer like me then this is very minor and can always be changed to fit my taste. no pc gamer should ever complain about controls unless you can not remap which you can in Dark Souls III. So be prepared to Die and love every minute of it."

        "Comments": "Posted: April 24, 2018              First Souls game I have played. I found the game by searching for something that might give me the same feel as Onimusha from PlayStation 2, but for PC. I found a trailer for Bloodborne, but this is a PlayStation exclusive. I looked up the developer and came across Dark Souls. I decided to try Dark Souls 3 since it was the newest of the series and it appeared to have great reviews. It had a little bit of the Onimusha feel that I was looking for, but obviously more up to date and modern. Of course the game was hard at first and took a little bit to get it, but the feel, the visuals, the challenge were all amazing. Thoughout the whole game I was still learning up until the end. I beat the game and I think all bosses except for one optional boss which I still plan on beating and eventually starting NG+. The online play is also exciting and just fun. The community is full of fun and very good players, and you will die, and you will die, and you will die, and you will die, and you will die. But damn does it feel good when you beat that boss, kill that invader, win your first undead match, and make your first successful invasion. I recomend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge and may get bored with many standard games that don't keep your interest. This has become by far my favorite game series and I've already bought and started Dark Souls 2 and waiting for Dark Souls Remastered. Why am I going backwards in the series? It hasn't made me enjoy it any less. I'm glad I started with 3. And now I have a better understanding for working on 2 and I can't wait for Remastered. Get this game."

Which is to say 1000's upon 1000's of hours across 4 different platforms. While I love a Bethesda rpg there is a special magic to FromSoft games that's leaves me feeling like I've been through gaming nirvana. A transcendent and resplendent look into the purity of gaming. Dark Souls 3 maintains that standard of excellence and had already endeared itself to me.  Earning a position, along with the first iteration, in my top 10 favorite games of all time. So if you're on the fence, don't hesitate to be consumed by this gaming royalty. 9.9/10"

Gone is the shrinking health bar of DS2, gone are the non replenishing consumables of Bloodborne and the bosses' health pool seems to have been lowered a lot.Unfortunately, i felt like a lot of the areas were too small, and shortcuts too frequent, and the overall result was a diminished feeling of challenge, and with it satisfaction. Oh, and some  look at me i'm so old-school  mechanics that should just die are still there, such as unmarked phantom walls that you will need a guide to spot.That being said, Darks Souls 3 remains a great experience, with the variety of approaches that you can take at every challenge set before you, the great level and enemy design and, finally, visuals that live up to their name.+ Traditionally great level and enemy design+ Solid skills, weapons and armor balancement+ Fast paced, enjoyable combat+ The most accessible Souls+ Stable framerate and great graphics- No 21:9 support (Fixed by my man Kaldaien)- Lack of challenge for veterans- Too much missable content without a guide- Repetitive environments (Thank you DLCs)4/5"

        "Comments": "Posted: October 29, 2016              Years from now, Dark Souls III is going to be known as the  Ocarina of Time  of the series. Compared to the previous Souls games: artifical difficult has been replaced by unique and skillful execution, quality of life nuisances have been remedied, and sound/visuals have been improved drastically. In a nutshell, the biggest difference in Dark Souls III is that you aren't being tested for your patience/discipline. DS3 tests you for your skill. In DS1/2, dying was infuriating, and winning was a relief. In DS3, dying is awe-inspiring, and winning makes you feel like a lord. I whole-heartedly recommend you get this game. As soon as I got it, I couldn't stop playing it (I put in 68 hours over 5 weeks while working full-time and going to school). It is not flawless, but it is a clear 9/10. It's quite a enjoyable and rewarding experience.Also, in your times of struggle, remember that every death is meant to be a lesson. The game wants you to succeed.MechanicsWeapons are extremely unique and most of them are viable in PvE. You get to just pick whatever you want and feel like the badass that you want. Boss weapons are not impossible to come by and often feel the best. There are also many more choices for each weapon based on their  arte , which are more than just a guard break or a lunge forward. The movement/dodge system is much faster and more responsive. This would be very OP in previous Dark Souls games, but enemies in previous DS titles also were hard countered by circle-backstab anyway. The rolls in this game are appropriately needed for the changes in enemy move sets. It overall just feels better just to run around and battle.The convenants and merchants are infinitely less cumbersome than previous. Discovering a merchant relocates them to Firelink Shrine, in which all merchants and most NPCs will stay. You won't have to go traveling for 4 minutes just to get your weapon upgraded after you buy some pyromancies anymore. Convenants are also joined by being given a Sigil following discovery. You can just swap convenants by switching this slot in your inventory instead of hunting down the convenant leader again. Also, a merchant dying no longer means that you lose their products. All in all, it is much less of a chore to do small tasks like these.The equivalent of being human is called being Embered. Unlike in previous games, this is actually useful (you get 30% extra hp). This means that more people embered overall = more PvP interaction. Also, you gain embered status for beating a boss, which means more people want to put down their summon sign to help out others with a tough boss. Summoning also has a level limit, so you don't have to be scared of getting invaded from someone light years ahead of you in levels/gear. All of these mechanics lead to greater and more meaningful player interaction throughout your time in Lothric.You get to warp between bonfires from the get-go, and you also don't have to upgrade specific bonfires. Some have complained that this makes the world feel a bit smaller, but I disagree. The world is extremely connected save 1 or 2 exceptions, and you can see almost every other point in the game from one another. Bonfires are also a bit more on rails, meaning that it's tough to miss one. Previously, hidden bonfires (especially in the Tomb of the Giants in DS1) could completely change the flow of how you play the game based on whether you stumble upon it or not. There's also a generally lower amount of arbitraryâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that would punish you for lack of prior knowledge.The weapon crafting system no longer punishes you for making a choice. You can simply swap the properties of a +10 weapon instead of having to find another one and go through the full upgrade path each time. The information about each weapon is much easier to process and there are more choices for whatever nuianced build you're trying. The menu overall is extremely good. You can finally navigate on a grid instead of a list, and you can tab between menus for your armor/weapons. You can have more rings and items equipped simultaneously. You can also view your status to see how many souls you need for a next level instead of stopping by a specific location. It is overall just much easier on the eyes, and it is optimized to provide convenient access to information.CombatThe bosses follow suit in the weapons improvement, and (with few exceptions) they all feel varied and deep. I've fought some bosses almost 40 times and will still see some new moves. The AI is also programmed well enough to show human tendencies like getting greedy or faking out a move. You would be able to look up a guide on these most bosses and still not find the secret to beating them. In previous DS games, it felt like you would cheese all of the bosses because they'd cheese you (just walk near them and stand behind every boss). Sometimes, you'll want to intentionally separate yourself from a boss as much as possible. Some bosses have moves to punish you positioning close; other bosses have moves to punish you for rolling as a reaction to anything. DS3 bosses have several move sets that keep it fresh several times over. I never noticed how terribly annoying previous Dark Souls bosses were (from walking to each boss to the small gimmicks and lack of tactics) until realizing how good it could be when I played DS3.Honorable mention is that the Final Boss is an absolute beast. He is the summation of all who have ever Linked the Flame; therefore, his fight is the deepest and most  complete  that I could say I remember in a video game. He's not this way because he just  has a lot of stages  or takes 30 minutes to beat, but because he contains every popular player build and you will find something different each time you play him. There is also a bit of an emotional moment in which the music for Gwyn, the original Lord of Cinder, plays and he begins using Gwyn's sword. Sometimes you feel so emotionally connected with him, that you almost don't want to win. The normal enemies are what you would expect, but there is fortunately a bit less mob behavior. I thought that mob behavior was a bit of a cheap excuse for difficulty, and the AI programming and enemy design has made up that difficulty in a more meaningful way in DS3. I unfortunately don't know too much about serious PvP, but my experience with the invasions mechanics have been pleasant when fighting another player. It hasn't really felt unfair at all, yet. Performance & Audio/VisualDrastic performance increase. 60 fps, unlocked resolutions (I played in 1440p). The draw distance is excellent and the environments are stunning. You will find several  Oh my god  moments in which you are greeted by amazing views en route to a new area. For a little bit of preview, look up the screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. The armor and characters are also extremely sharp, and the in-game rendered cutscenes are Blizzard quality.The audio is overhauled. The directional sound in the game rivals Counter-Strike 1.6. The materials and general pitter-pattering is very precise and varied throughout. The sounds in the game are also overall very clear; play a bit of Dark Souls 1 and you will notice a staggering difference.The music is the best of any in the series. Several songs feel like a perfect fit for the environment/boss, instead of just sounding like generic background tunes. Pretty much any boss theme is great, but Abyss Watchers, Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Father Ariandel and Sister Friede (from the DLC), Twin Princes, and Oceiros get honorable mentions for great music. The Main Menu theme is pretty damn good, too."

It's not for casual players, but for ones looking for really hardcore challenge. I also played the first edition of this game - prepare to die - and it taught me that 3rd part will not be any easier, damn, it's even harder than first one, and that's why I love it!This game is not about mindlessly rushing fordward, happly slaughtering anything you'll see, by doing so you are only going to meet your death even more often than before. In Dark Souls series, every enemy needs to be taken on rather strategically, especially minibosses like Crystal Lizard or elite enemies like Black Knight - this enemy will give you a lot of pain if you underestimate him, as his 3 blows are usually enought to remove your guts. During this duel, you have to learn his moveset in order to beat him.PROS-Ultra challenging-Fighting system-Huge world-Amazing hidden story-Lots of connections to the first DS-Many possible builds-Teaches you to never give up-One of best TPRPG games I played so far-Crazy, unique bosses, usually with intresting story behind-Motherf- mimics-Dead enemy ragdolsCONS-Hitboxes.

So overall, I'd say this is the easiest Dark Souls I've played, but geez I sort of have been training hard for these things, you know?What I can say compared to other games:- The Co-op is fun, but there isn't a dual boss like Ornstein and Smough, the Sentinels, the Throne Guardians, those two â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tigers or whatnot. Dark Souls is a challenging game and there is nothing that builds an everlasting friendship than in going up against a boss and trusting your back to a friend. - There are a lot of AI holes you can exploit. I found a bunch of spots where enemies would refuse to advance on you because they apparently are not supposed to leave their designated zones. Maybe it's because I'm savvy to how the games work, but still. - The Fashion Souls game is alright, but I never found anything like the Desert Sorceress outfit. :( - The story is... great. I'm really looking forward to VaatiVidya videos for this one. Special shout out to the moments where you go to the Abyssal Firelink Shrine. In any case, Dark Souls is great. I look forward to DLCs."

Everyone does the same few builds.. and that is what ever weapon will 2hit. Meaning when you land a hit with left click(RB1) you're guaranteed a second with with RB1 and your opponent can't block or dodge. What a combo right!?! Such skill much good. And then they will usually  point down  you. Which isn't anything except an insult like they are saying you'reâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ As if they possess skill for doing the same 2hit combo buils -.-Kinda rusttles your jimmies when they message you and say you're bad because they 2hit you. zomg salt post much xD"
